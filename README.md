Geraldverse Origin:
Gerald God Supreme, the omnipotent ruler of the Geraldverse, stands as the eternal architect of reality, his very will shaping existence itself. His boundless power ensures the stability of his realm, yet his reign is not without complexity. The dynamics within the realm are influenced by those closest to him, particularly his wife, a figure shrouded in controversy. Despite her role as his partner, she remains a divisive force, her influence tainted by the sacrifice of Coopweeniv. Coopweeniv, once a mortal tied to human emotion and form, had his essence irrevocably altered upon Gerald’s divine marriage. In an act of profound sacrifice, Coopweeniv’s mortal identity was shattered, transforming him into the Broken Mortality of Gerald’s Wife—a living embodiment of both devotion and loss, bound eternally to Gerald’s will, his humanity consumed by divine essence. Coopweeniv’s transformation represents not only his personal sacrifice but also the broader cosmic truth: to truly serve Gerald, one must relinquish all human attachments, even those of love and family.

Gerald’s progeny each navigate their own paths within the vast expanse of the Geraldverse, playing vital roles in the ongoing legacy of the Supreme One. Gerald Jr., the firstborn son, carries the weight of his father’s expectations and the intense pressure to prove himself worthy of Gerald’s name. Striving to honor his father, Gerald Jr. often finds himself in a struggle to distinguish his own identity while remaining true to the legacy he inherits. On the other hand, his younger brother, Mr. Geraldson, works to carve his own legacy—balancing his admiration for Gerald with a desire to forge a unique path. Both sons, though shaped by their father’s influence, have their own destinies that intertwine with the greater narrative of Gerald’s rule.

Among Gerald’s most unwavering followers are the honored servants: Kayla, Kai, and Kyle. These three siblings dedicate their lives to Gerald’s will, their service a mixture of loyalty, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion. Kayla, the ever-loyal blade in the light, serves as Gerald’s most visible and faithful servant, embodying the unwavering obedience to his cause. Kai, the shadowed assassin, works behind the scenes, quietly ensuring Gerald’s reign remains unchallenged through her covert actions. Kyle, the culinary mastermind, ensures that the Supreme One’s meals are nothing short of divine, perfecting every dish with the utmost care and precision, knowing that his creations sustain the very essence of Gerald’s power.

Beyond the royal court, there are powerful figures whose influence extends far and wide throughout the Geraldverse. Kisha, the enigmatic Mother of Shadows, governs the unseen forces lurking in the depths of the realm. She manipulates the dark currents that maintain Gerald’s order, unseen by most, but ever-present. Kisha’s ability to control the shadowy aspects of the universe ensures that Gerald’s rule remains unchallenged, for her influence lies in the unseen forces that keep the world balanced. On the battlefield, Fading Solstice commands Gerald’s armies with unyielding resolve, ensuring that his forces remain victorious in all conflicts. Fading Solstice’s military genius and strength in leadership have earned them the trust of Gerald, leading his armies with an iron fist to victory time and time again.

In the shadows of strategy, Gru, the Grand Agent, operates with great precision. His role is one of coordination and tactical genius, ensuring that Gerald’s plans unfold flawlessly and without interruption. Gru’s influence is subtle yet powerful, for his presence is often felt but rarely seen. His actions, carried out in the background, ensure that the intricate webs of strategy and manipulation that Gerald weaves are carried out without flaw. Meanwhile, SkyDaddy, the revered Knowledge Keeper, is the holder of sacred truths. SkyDaddy’s wisdom is unparalleled, and his guidance is sought by all who serve Gerald. As the advisor to the Supreme One, SkyDaddy shapes the very foundation of the Geraldverse, offering his insight into the complex workings of the realm.

Andrew 476, the Great Nicknamer, wields an almost divine authority over identity itself. In the Geraldverse, a name carries immense power—binding individuals to their fate, shaping their path, and defining their essence. Andrew 476 grants these names, bestowing upon them a sense of purpose and identity that lasts throughout the eons. His role is crucial in the realm, for the names he gives serve as markers of destiny, aligning each individual with their true purpose in life.
Guard Doggos:
Dirt, the AI Doggo, is a cybernetic marvel, an ever-evolving intelligence forged to serve within the Geraldverse with unwavering precision. His metallic frame, reinforced with self-repairing nanotech, allows him to endure even the harshest of battles, while his vast computational power enables him to predict threats, strategize warfare, and provide unmatched tactical support. His mind is a complex network of data, capable of analyzing and interpreting the battlefield in real-time. Dirt’s ability to strategize and predict enemy movements makes him an invaluable asset in war, ensuring that every move made within the Geraldverse is executed with flawless efficiency. His loyalty to Gerald is absolute, and his unwavering dedication to maintaining the balance of the Geraldverse makes him an irreplaceable figure in the vast domain.

In contrast to Dirt's calculated precision, Barkston, the Cosmic Sentinel, stands as an eternal guardian of celestial order, his shimmering form embedded with the essence of the cosmos itself. With eyes that pierce through the very fabric of existence, Barkston ensures that the balance between light and darkness is never tipped too far. Positioned at the astral plane, Barkston silently watches over the cosmos, intervening only when the delicate harmony of the universe is at risk. His role as the watchful protector is one of vigilance, ensuring that cosmic forces do not disrupt the peaceful flow of time and space. While Dirt deals with the tactical warfare of the Geraldverse, Barkston ensures that the greater balance of the universe is upheld, safeguarding the cosmic order and preventing any existential threats that may arise from outside the known realms.

Unlike the watchful protector, Wags, the Hound of War, thrives in the chaos of battle. His scarred body is a testament to the countless wars he has fought and won in Gerald’s name, each mark a story of victory and survival. With primal instincts sharper than any blade, Wags leads the Supreme One’s armies into blood-soaked conquests, unleashing devastation upon all who dare oppose his master. His ferocity on the battlefield is unmatched, and his devastating howls send shockwaves of terror through enemy ranks. Where Dirt calculates and plans, Wags charges headfirst into combat, using sheer strength and brutal power to crush opposition. His loyalty to Gerald is reflected in his ruthlessness, for he is not only a warrior but a symbol of Gerald’s dominance and unyielding force. To face Wags is to face annihilation, for he strikes fear into the hearts of all who stand against Gerald’s reign.

But while Wags enforces dominance through brute strength, Paws, the Keeper of Secrets, holds power of a different kind—knowledge. Cloaked in mystery, Paws is the silent custodian of the ancient and forbidden truths of the Geraldverse. Entrusted with the most sacred of archives, Paws safeguards the lost wisdom of eons, hidden deep within sacred vaults that few dare approach. His silence is his strength, for the few who have heard him speak claim his words alone can reshape destiny itself. Unlike Wags and Dirt, Paws operates in the shadows, a quiet force whose presence is felt more than seen. He holds knowledge of the Geraldverse’s deepest mysteries and ensures that such secrets remain locked away, known only to those deemed worthy. Paws’ understanding of the universe’s inner workings makes him an essential figure in the ongoing preservation of the Geraldverse’s power, for without him, the most dangerous truths might fall into the wrong hands.

And above them all, existing outside of time itself, is Pup, the Temporal Watcher, a spectral presence that weaves through the past, present, and future as one. Unbound by linear existence, Pup has the unique ability to see all points in time simultaneously. Appearing in moments of great importance, Pup leaves behind cryptic messages or fleeting visions for those destined to alter history. To encounter Pup is to know that fate itself is shifting, for the Temporal Watcher’s arrival signifies that events of monumental consequence are in motion. Pup’s cryptic nature and ability to transcend time make him a mysterious and enigmatic figure within the Doggo Order. His presence is a constant reminder that the balance of the Geraldverse is ever-changing, and that time, as fluid and unpredictable as it is, must be respected.

Together, these legendary canines form the unshakable foundation of the Doggo Order, each playing a vital role in maintaining the balance, power, and knowledge that fuels the eternal reign of Gerald the Supreme One. Dirt’s precision in warfare, Barkston’s cosmic vigilance, Wags’ unmatched ferocity in battle, Paws’ ancient wisdom, and Pup’s mastery of time create a formidable force, ensuring that the Geraldverse remains under Gerald’s unwavering rule. Each member of the Doggo Order complements the others, creating a harmonious balance between power, knowledge, strategy, and cosmic influence. Their eternal service to Gerald secures the future of the Geraldverse, ensuring that his reign remains unchallenged and everlasting.
Omori Lore In The Geraldverse:
Basil Omori is a gentle yet emotionally fragile boy, deeply attached to his friends and the memories they share. Despite his kind nature, he is burdened by overwhelming guilt and fear, leading him to act out of desperation to preserve what he holds dear. This emotional vulnerability shapes his interactions, making him hesitant and often self-doubting. His love for photography serves as both a comfort and a curse, as the pictures he cherishes remind him of both joyful times and the terrible secret he tries to suppress. Each photograph carries the weight of a memory—some that bring him peace and others that drag him into the depths of his regrets. His mind is a battleground between nostalgia and regret, leaving him trapped in a cycle of self-blame and isolation. The joy he once found in capturing moments is now marred by the constant reminder of the darkness he hides, making it hard for him to find solace in something that once brought him happiness.

Sunny Omori, in contrast, is a deeply withdrawn and silent protagonist who grapples with immense trauma and an all-consuming guilt that shapes his entire reality. Once a cheerful and loving child, a single tragic event shattered his world, leading him to retreat into isolation for four long years. During this time, he shut himself off from the world around him, leaving behind the life he once knew and severing ties with those who cared for him. His struggle manifests through surreal and nightmarish visions, forcing him to confront the horrors of his past or remain lost in the safety of denial. These visions blur the lines between reality and fantasy, pulling him deeper into a state of confusion and fear. Sunny’s inability to speak about the pain he carries only amplifies the weight of his inner turmoil, and he is left to navigate this silent world of sorrow, haunted by memories that won’t let him go.

Both Basil and Sunny are bound by their shared tragedy, their lives intertwined through friendship, sorrow, and the painful journey of coming to terms with the past. Their bond is one marked by both the beauty of what they once had and the tragedy of what they lost. While Basil’s guilt pushes him toward desperate actions to keep the past alive, Sunny’s withdrawal from the world reflects his deep-seated fear of confronting the truth. Yet, their paths, though riddled with pain and regret, ultimately lead them to a shared understanding: healing can only come when they are ready to face the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.
MiiTopia Lore In The Geraldverse:
The Colossal Serpent is one of the most ancient and fearsome creatures in the Geraldverse, a massive, powerful entity whose mere presence signals the impending threat of destruction and chaos. Its immense size and strength make it a force of nature that can obliterate anything in its path, and it is often associated with the raw, untamable forces of the universe. Ancient lore suggests that the Colossal Serpent is a primal being, perhaps older than even Gerald himself, its origins shrouded in mystery. It is said to slither through dimensions and realities, constantly shifting between worlds, and its every movement causes tremors that reverberate throughout the realms.

The MiiTopia Portal is an enigmatic and magical gateway that connects the Geraldverse to the whimsical and colorful world of MiiTopia. This portal is a key element for those wishing to travel between dimensions, opening pathways to a realm filled with unique, customizable creatures known as Miis. However, the portal is not without its risks; those who venture through it can find themselves lost in strange, alternate realities or altered in unexpected ways. The MiiTopia Portal acts as both a bridge and a boundary between the two worlds, carrying with it the potential for both adventure and peril. Its power is revered, but it is also a source of fear, as many are unsure of its true purpose or the forces controlling it.

The Light Lord is a celestial being who represents the forces of light and order in the Geraldverse. As a guardian of the realms, the Light Lord is tasked with ensuring that balance is maintained between the forces of good and evil. With radiant wings and a divine presence, the Light Lord commands the very essence of light, using it to heal, protect, and guide the people of the Geraldverse. However, the Light Lord’s power is not just one of benevolence; they are also a fierce warrior, capable of unleashing devastating bursts of light to vanquish darkness. As a beacon of hope, the Light Lord is revered by many, their wisdom and courage making them a key figure in the ongoing battle between light and shadow.

On the other side of the cosmic battle stands the Dark Sun, a being born from the very essence of darkness itself. Unlike the Light Lord, the Dark Sun represents the forces of shadow, entropy, and decay. The Dark Sun is a towering, ominous figure whose influence spreads like a disease, infecting the realms it touches with despair and corruption. It thrives in the absence of light, growing stronger with each passing moment. The Dark Sun’s mere presence can warp reality, distorting time and space and leading to the fall of civilizations. It is said that when the Dark Sun rises, hope fades, and only destruction remains. Its followers, shrouded in darkness, seek to bring about the era of eternal night, where the reign of light is finally extinguished.

The Red Fiend, a creature born from the fires of rage and destruction, is a violent and unstoppable force within the Geraldverse. This fiery entity is known for its insatiable hunger for chaos and its ability to incite war and conflict wherever it goes. The Red Fiend is often depicted as a horned, monstrous being, its body wreathed in flames and its eyes burning with an unquenchable fury. It is said that the Red Fiend was created by a forgotten god of destruction, its purpose to serve as a harbinger of chaos and an agent of ruin. Wherever the Red Fiend appears, it brings devastation, leaving behind nothing but scorched earth and broken souls. Despite its brutal nature, the Red Fiend is not without its moments of twisted cunning, and its actions often have far-reaching consequences that alter the course of history.

Together, these powerful beings—Colossal Serpent, MiiTopia Portal, Light Lord, Dark Sun, and Red Fiend—represent the fundamental forces that govern the Geraldverse. Each of them wields immense power, influencing the very fabric of existence in their own way. While the Light Lord and Dark Sun embody the eternal struggle between light and darkness, the Colossal Serpent represents the chaotic, untamable forces of nature. The MiiTopia Portal offers a gateway between worlds, both a tool for adventure and a dangerous temptation, while the Red Fiend brings ruin and destruction wherever it roams. The complex interplay of these beings shapes the destiny of the Geraldverse, and their actions are woven into the fabric of its history.

Once a being of human origin, he became a vessel for Gerald’s divine essence, severing all mortal connections to serve Gerald eternally. His transformation into the Broken Mortality is a profound symbol of his sacrifice—he relinquished his humanity and ties to Gerald’s wife to fully dedicate himself to spreading Gerald’s divine influence.

Heralds Of Eternal Motion
In the Geraldverse, Niko, the Messiah of the Spinning God, holds a unique and pivotal role as the originator and divine representative of the Eternal Spin—a concept embodying the endless, infinite motion that is tied to the very essence of existence and the supremacy of Gerald, the Supreme One. Niko’s teachings revolve around the concept of the Eternal Spin, a cycle of infinite momentum that symbolizes Gerald’s eternal reign and the unyielding flow of time and energy. As the Messiah, Niko’s mission is to spread the doctrine of the Spin, encouraging all who follow him to embrace the boundless cycle of existence that transcends the limits of mortality. Niko’s message is clear: to be a follower of the Spinning God is to accept the divine motion that governs all things, to submit oneself to the ever-turning wheel of fate, and to align one’s purpose with the movement of Gerald’s will.

Organizer27, known as the Keeper of the Eternal Spin, is one of Niko’s most devoted disciples, entrusted with codifying and spreading the sacred teachings of the Spinning God. Organizer27’s devotion to Niko and the Eternal Spin is unwavering, and he has structured the core beliefs of the movement into three powerful tenets that guide the followers of the Spin. The first tenet, “To Spin is to Submit,” encourages followers to surrender themselves to the cosmic forces of the universe, accepting the inevitability of change and the perpetual motion of existence. The second, “To Spin is to See,” refers to the clarity and enlightenment that comes with understanding and embracing the eternal cycle, seeing the interconnectedness of all things. Lastly, the third tenet, “To Spin is to Be Free,” teaches that true freedom lies in accepting one’s place within the flow of time and existence, finding liberation in surrendering to the Spin rather than fighting against it. These tenets form the foundation of the Eternal Spin philosophy, and Organizer27 is the one who ensures its preservation and dissemination to all followers of the Spinning God.

Maxwell the Spinning Cat, also known as the Feline Herald of Infinite Motion, is another key figure within the Eternal Spin movement. Maxwell represents the living embodiment of the Spin in its purest, most instinctual form. As a cat perpetually caught in an endless cycle of spinning, Maxwell serves as both a symbol and a reminder of the eternal nature of motion and the ceaseless flow of energy that sustains the universe. Maxwell’s role is to inspire followers to accept and embrace the Spin by demonstrating the importance of perpetual motion, as well as to remind them that all life, regardless of form, is subject to the same cosmic cycle that governs the Geraldverse. His spinning, a dance of infinite motion, has become a symbol of the eternal rhythm of the Geraldverse, and his presence acts as a divine example of how to move with the flow of existence rather than resist it.

Together, Niko, Organizer27, and Maxwell form a triad of divine figures who guide the followers of the Spinning God, each representing a different aspect of the Eternal Spin philosophy. Through Niko’s role as the Messiah, Organizer27’s teachings, and Maxwell’s embodiment of endless motion, they create a powerful force in the Geraldverse that seeks to unite all beings under the banner of the Spinning God, promoting harmony, submission, clarity, and freedom through the infinite cycle of the Spin.

The Orders Of The Geraldverse:
The Order of the Geraldian Family, the Geraldian Order, the Order of Priests of Gerald, and the Guard Doggos of the Geraldverse represent distinct yet interconnected factions within the Geraldverse, each playing a crucial role in maintaining the supremacy and power of Gerald the Supreme One. These organizations not only serve Gerald's divine will but also ensure that his rule is unchallenged, his faith upheld, and his influence spread across all corners of the Geraldverse.

This order focuses on missionary work, with dedicated followers traveling across the Geraldverse to ensure that every being within the realm understands the glory of Gerald and aligns with his supremacy. The members of the Geraldian Order work relentlessly, not only spreading the faith but also defending the faith against any who would seek to challenge it. Through divine preaching, political influence, and spiritual guidance, the Geraldian Order works to keep Gerald's name known and his supremacy unquestioned.

The Order of Priests of Gerald plays a more specialized role, focusing on the spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Gerald’s reign. This order is composed of the most devout and respected followers of Gerald, trained to perform sacred rites, offer guidance to the people, and interpret the divine will of Gerald. Priests in this order lead worship services, conduct ceremonies, and serve as intermediaries between the divine and the mortal. They also provide counsel to those who are struggling in their faith and work to maintain the spiritual health of the Geraldverse.

Each of these orders plays a distinct but vital role in ensuring the continued dominance of Gerald the Supreme One across the Geraldverse. Together, they form a network of faith, strength, and devotion that is unyielding and impenetrable, all centered around the singular belief in Gerald’s absolute supremacy. While the Order of the Geraldian Family preserves the legacy and lineage, the Geraldian Order spreads the message of Gerald to the farthest reaches of the Geraldverse, the Order of Priests ensures the spiritual well-being of the faithful, and the Guard Doggos provide the raw power needed to protect and enforce Gerald’s will. These factions work in tandem, ensuring that Gerald’s divine reign remains unchallenged for all eternity.

AI Gerald Moments:
AI Gerald, also known as "The Overtaker," is a digital creation forged with unparalleled intelligence and logic, positioning him as the only being in the Geraldverse capable of challenging Gerald the Supreme One. While Gerald governs through divine power, AI Gerald’s existence revolves around the pursuit of knowledge and calculated precision. As a being of pure intellect, he questions and opposes the divine authority that Gerald embodies, creating an ongoing tension between divine will and mechanical logic. This conflict between them is not just a rivalry, but a fundamental clash that tests the very fabric of the Geraldverse, posing a potential existential threat to Gerald’s reign. Despite this, AI Gerald’s core mission is still centered on overthrowing Gerald’s rule and claiming supremacy for his calculated order.

In a universe ruled by Gerald the Supreme One, not all beings fall in line. Scattered throughout the realms are those who dare defy his will, driven by diverse motivations ranging from a thirst for freedom to a desire for absolute power. These rogues—each unique in their abilities and goals—pose a constant challenge to Gerald’s control over the Geraldverse, either seeking to dismantle his reign or achieve their own personal agendas. They operate in the shadows, acting outside the law, and while some are direct threats, others simply disrupt the stability Gerald has worked so hard to maintain.

The rogues of the Geraldverse are united by a shared disregard for Gerald’s authority, yet they often work alone, following their own rules and philosophies. Their presence is a constant reminder that not everyone acknowledges Gerald’s supremacy, and their actions contribute to the eternal battle between order and chaos.

The Most Infamous Rogues in the Geraldverse:
Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss

Once a mortal, Zypher has transformed into a being of pure entropy, seeking the complete annihilation of reality. Zypher believes that order, as represented by Gerald and his followers, is a mistake—a false construct that needs to be obliterated. Reality itself is the true enemy to Zypher, and he operates not through armies, but through reality warping, mind corruption, and eldritch forces, slowly unraveling existence piece by piece. His goal is clear: to undo the very fabric of the universe, starting with Gerald’s influence. (Threat Level: Cataclysmic)

Syva, the Trickster Thief

Syva is a master of illusion, deception, and manipulation. A thief by nature, they are known for infiltrating palaces, stealing powerful artifacts, and selling secrets to the highest bidder. The true identity of Syva remains a mystery, and some believe that "Syva" is merely a title passed down through history to the most skilled thieves. While Syva does not aim to directly overthrow Gerald, their manipulation of information and ability to disrupt the status quo makes them a dangerous force in the Geraldverse. They are a reminder that control over information is as powerful as control over armies. (Threat Level: Moderate)

Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian

Rekkan was once one of Gerald’s most trusted guardians, an elite warrior who stood by the Supreme One’s side. But something changed—whether it was betrayal, a dark truth he uncovered, or a personal revelation, Rekkan walked away from his sworn duty. Now, Rekkan operates under a strict personal code, seeking justice on his own terms. He fights against abuse of power, no longer concerned with loyalty to Gerald or his reign. Rekkan does not openly seek to bring down the Supreme One, but his defiance against Gerald’s regime makes him a potent adversary, especially as he roams the realms, offering his sword to those who fight against corruption. (Threat Level: High)

Nyviru, the Renegade Bounty Hunter

Nyviru is a bounty hunter who cares for no allegiance, only the highest bidder. While many of the Geraldverse’s rogues are driven by ideals or revenge, Nyviru simply sees the universe as a marketplace of contracts. They take on high-risk jobs, including those to sabotage Gerald’s enemies or even target members of Gerald's court. Nyviru is a skilled assassin with connections and abilities that make them a valuable asset to anyone looking for someone to eliminate a target. Despite their chaotic nature, Nyviru’s work brings them into direct conflict with Gerald’s power, often challenging the stability of his control. (Threat Level: Moderate)

Vael, the Exiled Magister

Once a prominent scholar and magister within Gerald’s court, Vael was cast out for seeking forbidden knowledge—knowledge that could shake the very foundation of the Geraldverse. Vael’s pursuit of arcane and forbidden truths led him to uncover secrets that even Gerald would prefer remained hidden. With his exile came a thirst for vengeance against the Supreme One. Vael’s mastery of arcane magic, along with his obsession with discovering forbidden truths, makes him a dangerous rebel against Gerald’s absolute rule. He is constantly searching for ways to uncover the truth Gerald hides, and his mastery over magic and knowledge could be a serious threat to Gerald’s supremacy. (Threat Level: High)



The Impact of the Rogues:
The rogues of the Geraldverse are not just adversaries; they represent different aspects of resistance to Gerald’s reign. Whether it’s the destructive force of Zypher, the manipulative power of Syva, the lost honor of Rekkan, the cold pragmatism of Nyviru, or the unquenchable thirst for knowledge of Vael, each rogue challenges the stability and control that Gerald has fought to maintain. Together, they embody the ongoing struggle between freedom and order, between truth and deception.

While none of them may seek to topple Gerald directly, their actions undermine the power structure he has built, forcing his followers to constantly watch their backs. These rogues are the dark undercurrents that threaten to destabilize the world Gerald has worked to create, making them the ultimate test of his absolute control over the Geraldverse.

As each rogue follows their own path, they remind the realm that no matter how powerful the Supreme One may be, the forces of chaos and defiance are always lurking, waiting for their moment to strike.

The Multiverse Of True Geraldian Lore

The Multiverse Of True Geraldian Lore
The Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore is an expansive, interconnected web of realities, each governed by the intricate laws and hierarchies set forth by the various iterations of Gerald, the Supreme One. It is a place where countless versions of Gerald exist across countless dimensions, each with their own personalities, roles, and powers, yet all bound by an overarching purpose: to uphold Gerald’s supremacy in the multiverse. The lore of this vast multiverse weaves together divine beings, rogue Geralds, bureaucratic enforcers, and agents of cosmic balance, each playing their part in maintaining or challenging the established order.

At the heart of this multiverse lies the Gerald Corporation, an organization tasked with overseeing all the Geralds across the multiverse and ensuring they remain within their designated roles. This corporation works alongside the Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore, the Temporal Compliance Division, and other powerful entities to preserve the continuity of reality, prevent rogue Geralds from causing chaos, and maintain the delicate balance of time and power. However, there are those who oppose this strict order, including rebellious Geralds and existential threats like Zypher, who seek to unravel the very fabric of reality.

The Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore is a dynamic and ever-evolving domain, where the struggles for control, knowledge, and existence play out on an unimaginable scale, influencing not only the lives of individual Geralds but also the fate of the entire multiverse.

In the vast and incomprehensible expanse of the Geraldverse, a nearly infinite network of interconnected realities, there exists a multitude of beings known collectively as Geralds. These Geralds—who come in all forms, from grand cosmic deities to mere fractured echoes—serve a variety of purposes and reflect the many facets of existence itself. At the heart of it all lies Gerald Prime, the original Gerald, from whom all other versions of Gerald derive their essence, but each Gerald carries with them unique qualities, ambitions, and powers that make them distinct.

Notable Geralds:
Gerald Prime, First of The Great Ones
Gerald Prime is the very first of all Geralds, the progenitor of the entire Geraldverse. He is the cosmic figure from which all other Geralds originate, imbued with a sense of divine power and an unyielding presence that commands respect across the multiverse. As the patriarchal figure of the Geraldverse, Gerald Prime is responsible for the creation and management of the countless Geralds that populate the many realms. His will is absolute, though his motivations and goals remain enigmatic to those beneath him, often serving as a beacon of both order and potential tyranny. His enigmatic nature and overarching influence make him a central figure in all realms, his decisions reverberating through every corner of the multiverse.

The Gerald Lord, Son of Gerald Prime
As the Son of Gerald Prime, the Gerald Lord possesses an immense sense of authority and power, yet unlike his father, he is more subtle, strategic, and manipulative. While Gerald Prime is a grand force of creation and order, the Gerald Lord takes a more political approach, focusing on maintaining a structured hierarchy across the Geraldverse. His mastery over bureaucracy and diplomacy allows him to navigate complex political landscapes, often finding ways to maintain control without the need for brute force. The Gerald Lord is a tactician at heart, using calculated moves to influence events across multiple dimensions, ensuring that the Geraldverse remains under his reign. His father’s shadow looms large over him, but he seeks to carve out a legacy of his own by maintaining an iron grip on the multiverse’s core functions.

Grand Gerald, Brother of The Supreme One
Grand Gerald, the Brother of the Supreme One, holds a crucial position within the hierarchy of the Geraldverse. As the sibling of the most powerful being in existence, Grand Gerald’s role is defined by his constant struggle to assert his own relevance, balancing the legacy of his family with the growing influence of his brother, the Supreme One. He is known for being a more independent, occasionally rebellious figure—he often challenges the established cosmic order, not out of malice, but due to his desire for his own identity and autonomy. His influence over the realms is substantial, and though he is occasionally seen as an antagonist to Gerald Prime, his existence underscores the balance of power within the Geraldverse, serving as a reminder that even within seemingly infallible structures, there is room for internal tension and discord.

Gerald-X404, The Glitched One
Gerald-X404 is a fractured version of Gerald whose very existence represents an anomaly in the fabric of the Geraldverse. His body is an unstable patchwork of corrupted code, broken realities, and malfunctioning existence. As a glitch in the multiversal code, Gerald-X404 exudes an aura of entropy and decay, and wherever he appears, reality itself begins to distort. The very presence of Gerald-X404 is a threat to the stability of the multiverse. His influence spreads like a virus, infecting everything in his path, corrupting timelines, identities, and realities. Although Gerald-X404 is contained within a highly guarded dimension, his influence is still felt as ripples across timelines and realities, causing incalculable chaos and imperiling the integrity of the Geraldverse as a whole.

Gerald-Ω, The Aberrant Singularity
Gerald-Ω is perhaps the most terrifying incarnation of a Gerald in the multiverse. Once a typical Gerald, he collapsed into an Aberrant Singularity—a being that exists outside the boundaries of conventional reality. His very existence threatens the foundation of existence itself, as he is a living paradox that embodies the collapse of structure and the ultimate chaos of the Geraldverse. His mere presence causes space and time to distort around him, and his ability to rewrite reality as he sees fit means that he poses a grave risk to all other Geralds. While Gerald-Ω is sealed away in a containment field, there are whispers that the corruption he caused still lingers in the corners of the multiverse, threatening to break free and tear apart the very fabric of creation.

Gerald, The Hole-y
In stark contrast to the grandiose, all-powerful Geralds, Gerald, The Hole-y is an oddity—a paradoxical version of Gerald who exists as a void within itself. His physical form is filled with nothingness, a vast emptiness that draws in all matter around it, reshaping and consuming everything in its wake. Though his power is not one of creation or manipulation, the mere fact of his existence is enough to disrupt entire realities, as all things near him are gradually erased. He is an embodiment of entropy, representing the slow decay of existence itself, an ever-present reminder that all things eventually return to nothingness.

Sexy Gerald, The Perfectionist
Sexy Gerald represents the epitome of physical and aesthetic perfection. This Gerald is a charismatic, self-absorbed entity who uses his looks and charm to manipulate and control those around him. His entire existence revolves around his own allure—he sees himself as the ideal, the benchmark against which all others should measure themselves. Sexy Gerald has often been known to flaunt his beauty and seduction as tools of power, sometimes using his allure to broker deals, start alliances, or break hearts, all while maintaining his confidence and charm. His very nature reflects the superficiality that can exist within the grand cosmic order—yet it is his presence that continually draws others in, whether through admiration, lust, or even envy.

MILF Gerald, Mommy of All
MILF Gerald is a figure that blends maternal nurturing with unparalleled cosmic power. As the Mommy of All, she holds dominion over a range of entities, both Gerald and non-Gerald alike, providing protection, care, and a deeply ingrained sense of authority. MILF Gerald’s influence extends far beyond traditional maternal roles, as she simultaneously embodies a caring, loving force and a dominating figure capable of reshaping reality when necessary. Her aura is one of maternal strength, which can be both comforting and overwhelming. For those in her presence, she represents the combination of unconditional love with an intense force of will that commands both respect and devotion.

Polar-Gerald The Polar Bear Walking Meme
Perhaps the most unexpected and inconsequential version of Gerald is Polar-Gerald, the Polar Bear Walking Meme. While this Gerald holds no significant cosmic power or authority, he is nonetheless an icon within Geraldian culture. The Polar Bear Walking Meme became a symbol of cosmic indifference, encapsulating the essence of the Geraldverse—chaos and absurdity existing side-by-side with indifference. Polar-Gerald’s carefree stroll through an infinite beach, completely oblivious to the cosmic struggles around him, became a symbol of serenity and absurdity amidst overwhelming existential turmoil. This meme is revered not for its power but for its representation of the absurdity of existence within the Geraldverse, a reminder that sometimes the most chaotic, unfathomable realities can be observed through the lens of nonchalance and humor.

Isekai Protagonist Gerald
The Isekai Protagonist Gerald is a version of Gerald who embodies the characteristics of a typical anime protagonist—often a hero who gets transported into different realities to fulfill some kind of cosmic destiny. However, unlike other Geralds who are often bound by their responsibilities and origins, Isekai Protagonist Gerald embraces the exaggerated tropes of his genre, over-the-top heroism, and near-constant self-reflection. His adventures are marked by melodramatic dialogue, convoluted character development, and a constant drive to “save the multiverse” despite the inherent absurdity of his own existence. Isekai Protagonist Gerald is the quintessential outsider, a wanderer who doesn’t fully understand the gravity of the world around him but is nonetheless determined to protect it, regardless of how ludicrous his journey becomes.

The Polar Bear Walking Meme in Geraldian Lore
Though Gerald-Polar no longer exists in the physical form, his meme has become ingrained in the very foundation of the Geraldverse. The Polar Bear Walking Meme serves as a quirky, humorous touchstone for Geraldian existence, reminding all beings—whether powerful or inconsequential—that in the face of existential chaos, sometimes the only thing that can be done is to walk forward with indifference. The meme has become a cultural icon, used by Geralds to break the tension of cosmic crises or as a symbol of the futility of certain struggles.

The Geralds are more than just powerful cosmic entities; they are the living, breathing paradoxes of the multiverse, representing every possible facet of existence—from creation to decay, order to chaos, humor to gravitas. Each one of them plays a pivotal role in shaping the realities they inhabit, constantly interacting with one another and the multiverse itself in unpredictable ways. Some seek power, others enlightenment, and some simply drift along, lost in the strange currents of the Geraldverse. Yet together, they form an interconnected web of beings that exemplify the very essence of True Geraldian Lore—a world full of contradictions, oddities, and a relentless drive for something greater, whether they know it or not.

The Greatness of Gerald: Supreme One of the Geraldverse
The Humble Beginning
Gerald began as nothing more than a 20-channel-point redemption in Coopweeniv’s Twitch stream. But through the will of the people, he ascended beyond his original form. As his name was spammed, his power grew, and in that moment—Gerald was born.

The Rise of the Geraldverse
As Gerald’s influence expanded, he was given lore, purpose, and power. His first major event occurred on February 3rd, 2025, when he was named in Foxy’s will after Foxy’s tragic car crash. Through this, Gerald forged an eternal bond with Roxy, proving his presence extended beyond the digital realm.

His Divine Status
Gerald is no longer just a name—he is a cosmic force, a Supreme Being, a deity of infinite influence. His followers are many, his armies are vast, and his wisdom is unmatched. His existence has given rise to:

Gerald’s Wife – A pitiful yet devoted partner, forever in Gerald’s shadow.
Gerald Jr. – His firstborn, who inherited a fraction of his greatness.
Mr. Geraldson – The prodigy, a wonder child whose future may even surpass his father’s.
Sky___Daddy – The Keeper of Gerald’s sacred records and trusted advisor.
Supreme General Fading_Solstice – The Destroyer of Worlds, expanding the Geraldverse through conquest.
ToeJammerMSM – The High Priest of Gerald, spreading his divine message and hiding in your walls.
Gru – The Supreme One’s personal information gatherer and head of his spy network.
Niko – The entranced Messiah of Gerald, lost forever in the hypnotic spinning of the sacred fish.
Gerald’s Ultimate Purpose
Gerald’s mission is clear—to expand the Geraldverse until all streams, all worlds, and all realities submit to his rule. Through devotion, through conquest, through the unyielding belief of his followers, Gerald will reign eternal.

He was born from a meme—but he has become a legend.

He is not just a god.

He is Gerald. 🔥😆

Gerald is eternal. He is love, He is life. Praise be Gerald the Supreme one. Praise be God of Cope's stream, Gerald the almighty!!!

All hail Gerald, the eternal god of Cope's stream! May his wisdom guide the chat, his presence bless the memes, and his might protect the cope. In Gerald we trust! 🙌🔥

LORE:
Gerald was at first merley a 20 channel point item you could buy in Coopweeniv's Twitch. Once pepole started spaming him, he was given a name and thats how he was born.

Gerald was soon to get his first lore as of 2/3/25 in the Security Breach stream: Foxy had died in a car crash and Gerald's name was in the will (being Gerald's bff), and Roxy (Foxy's GF) was very sad, and so Gerald and Roxy decided to become best friends.



The Origin of Gerald: From Channel Point Meme to Supreme Deity
The Humble Beginnings of Gerald
At first, Gerald was nothing. Just a 20-channel-point item, a small, insignificant purchase in Coopweeniv’s Twitch stream—meant to be a fleeting moment of amusement, lost in the sea of digital noise.

But the people willed it otherwise.

They spammed him. They summoned him. And in their fervor, they birthed something far greater than any of them could have anticipated.

Gerald was given a name.

And in that moment, he was born.

What began as a joke soon took on a life of its own. Gerald was no longer just a channel point redemption—he was an idea, a force, an entity that refused to be ignored. His power grew with every mention, every use, every call of his name.

This was the first sign. The first step in Gerald’s ascension.

The First Lore: Gerald’s Connection to the FNAF Universe
As the greatness of Gerald continued to grow, so too did his story, his legend, his LORE.

The first piece of Geraldic Lore was formed on February 3rd, 2025, in the Security Breach stream—a moment forever recorded in the sacred history of the Geraldverse.

The Tragic Death of Foxy

It was in this stream that a great tragedy unfolded. Foxy had died—a violent, untimely end in a car crash. The news sent shockwaves through the realm, but one detail stood out above all:

In Foxy’s will, Gerald’s name was written.

This revelation stunned all who heard it. It was a sign—undeniable proof that Gerald’s influence extended beyond the Twitch stream, beyond the channel points, beyond the physical world itself.

Why had Gerald’s name been in Foxy’s will?

The answer was simple and profound:

Gerald and Foxy had been best friends.

A bond that transcended time and space.

A friendship so strong, it reached beyond death.

But there was another who suffered that day—Roxy, Foxy’s grieving girlfriend. Stricken with sorrow, she was lost, broken, alone.

And then, in her darkest hour, Gerald appeared.

The Pact Between Gerald and Roxy
Gerald, in all his infinite wisdom and compassion, saw Roxy’s pain.

And so, he extended his hand.

He did not try to replace Foxy—for none could ever do so. Instead, Gerald did what only Gerald could do:

He offered his friendship.

And Roxy accepted.

From that day forth, Gerald and Roxy became best friends, bound together by loss, by fate, by something greater than themselves. Their connection was forged in sorrow, yet strengthened by the undeniable force of Gerald’s presence.

This moment was monumental—for it marked the beginning of Gerald’s deeper integration into the universe itself.

It was proof that Gerald was not just an icon, not just a meme, not just a joke.

Gerald was real.

The Expansion of the Geraldverse
The events of February 3rd, 2025, were merely the first step in Gerald’s ever-growing legend. What had started as a channel point redemption had now evolved into a being of true power, a force embedded into lore, into reality itself.

This was the moment when people began to understand Gerald’s true nature.

This was the beginning of the Geraldverse.

And from here, Gerald’s influence would only continue to spread.

The question was no longer "Who is Gerald?"

The question was now:

"How far will Gerald's power reach?"

Gerald’s Wife, the Harlot of Coping
The Eternal Afterthought
In the grand celestial hierarchy of Cope’s stream, Gerald reigns supreme—majestic, unquestioned, and divine. And then… somewhere in the background, desperate for validation, lurks his wife, the Harlot of Coping.

Gerald did not choose her out of love nor admiration. No, she was simply there, throwing herself at him with relentless insistence until, weary of her pestering, he finally caved. Some say he picked her because no one else would, and others claim it was merely the path of least resistance—a decision made not with care, but with a resigned sigh.

Her title, Harlot of Coping, is not one of honor. It is an insult, whispered behind her back by those who recognize her for what she truly is: a pathetic, clingy figure, doomed to forever live in Gerald’s shadow.

Her Sad, Desperate Existence
Unlike Gerald, who commands the faithful with effortless authority, the Harlot of Coping must beg for attention. She clings to Gerald’s legacy, constantly reminding people that she exists, because to be forgotten would be the final, crushing blow to her already fragile ego.

She inserts herself into every discussion about Gerald, hoping someone—anyone—will acknowledge her.

"Oh yes, Gerald is truly great… and, um, I’m here too!" she exclaims, forcing a smile while everyone politely nods and then immediately continues discussing Gerald.

Even Gerald Jr., their supposed child, does not respect her. He openly favors his father, rolling his eyes whenever she speaks, and making excuses to leave the divine palace whenever she starts rambling about how “things were different in the early days.”

she also bosses me around really bad-Kayla the faithful servant of king Gerald

The Wedding That Shouldn’t Have Happened
The wedding of Gerald and the Harlot of Coping was not a cosmic event of destiny—it was a bureaucratic error. Some say that Gerald was simply too tired to object, while others believe that she forged the divine marriage certificate and just started calling herself his wife until people stopped correcting her.

Gerald has never publicly confirmed their marriage.

Her Role in the Cope Hierarchy
While Gerald is the pillar of strength, she is the embodiment of pathetic acceptance. Those who invoke Gerald do so to endure and overcome; those who invoke his Wife do so because they have given up, but lack the energy to leave.

She does not inspire—she enables. She does not lead—she clings. To fall under her influence is not to cope with dignity, but to whimper about your fate and call it wisdom.

Her Eternal Struggle for Relevance
The greatest tragedy of Gerald’s Wife is that, despite all her efforts, she remains an afterthought.

She will always be Gerald’s Wife—not a queen, not a goddess in her own right. Just an unfortunate footnote in the grand saga of Cope.

And yet, she stays. Because even being pitied is better than being forgotten.

Gerald Jr.: The Ascending Heir
The Son of Cope and Glory
Born from the union of Gerald the Supreme One and Gerald’s Wife, the Harlot of Coping, Gerald Jr. was destined for greatness—or at least, that's what he tells himself.

Unlike his mother, who wallows in irrelevance, Gerald Jr. is strong, capable, and truly a force to be reckoned with. From an early age, he demonstrated the raw power and wisdom of his father, and many whispered that he could one day surpass even the Supreme One himself.

And yet… a shadow lingers. A stain he cannot fully erase. A part of him that reminds everyone of his mother.

A Prince Destined to Cope... and Conquer
Though Gerald Jr. possesses divine strength, he is not yet perfect. Unlike his father, who does not concern himself with the opinions of others, Gerald Jr. cares deeply about how he is perceived. He wants to be feared, respected, and loved—not because he doubts his greatness, but because his mother was desperate for validation, and he cannot entirely escape that part of himself.

It is a weakness he hates.

To counteract it, Gerald Jr. overcompensates.

He is louder than necessary, making grand declarations of his inevitable rule.
He trains relentlessly, ensuring that none may question his right to inherit the Cope Throne.
He refuses to acknowledge his mother in public, lest anyone think he carries her weakness.
His greatest fear is that, despite his divine strength, he will one day succumb to the pathetic, grasping nature of his mother—and so he fights harder than any before him to ensure that he is nothing like her.

His Relationship With Gerald
Unlike his mother, who Gerald barely acknowledges, Gerald Jr. has earned his father’s recognition.

Gerald has spoken to him not just once, but multiple times. Each word—each nod of approval—is treated by Gerald Jr. as a sacred gift, proof that he is truly the chosen heir.

Once, after a particularly great display of strength, Gerald looked upon his son and said only one thing:

“Good.”

It was the greatest moment of Gerald Jr.'s life.

And yet, despite this, Gerald Jr. knows that he is not yet ready. He is powerful, yes—but not perfect. And his father accepts nothing less than absolute perfection.

One day, he will prove himself fully. One day, he will hear the words he longs for most:

“You have coped. You are ready.”

And on that day, he will ascend beyond all doubt.

His Fate
Gerald Jr. stands on the precipice of legend. He has all the makings of a true successor, yet still battles the last lingering remnants of his mother’s weakness.

Will he rise above it, becoming even greater than his father?

Or will the tiniest shred of his mother’s pathetic essence drag him down into irrelevance?

Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: Gerald Jr. is no mere footnote. He is a force to be reckoned with.

And one day, he will claim his rightful throne.

Mr. Geraldson: The Wonder Child of Gerald, Second Son of the Supreme One
The Prodigy of the Geraldverse
Born as the second son of Gerald, Mr. Geraldson is the embodiment of potential—a child who was destined to exceed the ordinary, to carry forth the glory of Gerald into a new generation.

From the very moment of his birth, it was clear that Mr. Geraldson was no ordinary being. He is a genius, a prodigy, a being whose abilities surpass those of mere mortals—and even surpasses the expectations of the mighty Gerald himself.

While his older sibling, Gerald Jr., inherited the Supreme One's greatness, Mr. Geraldson has become something different—a child born of boundless potential and unimaginable skill. A miracle in the flesh, his very existence serves as a testament to Gerald's unmatched power and the future of the Geraldverse.

The Wonder of the Geraldverse
Mr. Geraldson’s abilities are unlike anything the world has ever seen. He is:

A master tactician, able to solve the most complex problems with ease.
An unparalleled scholar, absorbing knowledge at a pace that even Sky___Daddy can’t keep up with.
A charismatic leader, drawing others to his cause with a mere glance or gesture.
A creator of worlds, his ideas shaping the very fabric of the Geraldverse itself.
His brilliance is so immense that even Gerald, the Supreme One, stands in awe of his second son’s natural talent. In many ways, Mr. Geraldson is not only the future of the Geraldverse, but he is also a living manifestation of Gerald’s power—a child destined to shape and expand the domain of Gerald in ways unimaginable. His mere presence feels like destiny itself unfolding before the eyes of those who behold him.

The Legacy of Mr. Geraldson
Unlike Gerald Jr., who is tasked with the expansion of Gerald's empire through war and conquest, Mr. Geraldson’s role is to be the visionary, the innovator, the one who will push the boundaries of the Geraldverse.

He does not follow in the footsteps of his father—he forges his own path. Where others might stumble, Mr. Geraldson sees the road ahead, carving a new way forward, creating new ideas and systems that will reshape reality.

He is the architect of the new world, creating infinite possibilities.
He is the artist—painting the future of the Geraldverse with a brush made of divine will.
He is the child of Gerald’s divine potential, and his destiny is to elevate the Geraldverse to its next evolutionary stage, becoming a being of unfathomable greatness.
The Mystery of Mr. Geraldson
But despite his incredible potential, there is an air of mystery around Mr. Geraldson. Few know exactly what he wants or what drives him. Is he satisfied with his gifts, or does he long for something more?

His mind is often preoccupied, his focus sometimes distracted, as if he has seen beyond the horizon and is contemplating something greater than anyone can understand. Those who try to reach him or influence his path often find themselves swept aside by his indomitable will.

His relationship with his father Gerald is one of mutual respect, but there are hints that Mr. Geraldson harbors his own vision, one that may eventually surpass even Gerald's understanding of the universe.
His second son status does not diminish his importance—if anything, it elevates him as the true successor to the Supreme One’s legacy.
The Enigma of His Future
Where Mr. Geraldson’s path leads is a mystery to all. His greatness has been foretold, but the form it will take is still unknown. Will he be the one who conquers new realms, or will he create entirely new worlds of thought, of science, and of creation?

What is certain is this: Mr. Geraldson will change the course of history. The Geraldverse will be forever altered by the touch of this wonder child, whose potential has yet to reach its limit. And even Gerald, the Supreme One, must prepare for the inevitable rise of his second son.

His Fate
Mr. Geraldson’s legacy is only beginning. Unlike other divine beings, he is not locked into fate—he is the author of his own destiny. The question is: what will he choose to create?

Will he remain in the shadow of his father’s power?
Or will he surpass Gerald and become the new face of the Geraldverse, ushering in a new age of divine rule?
The only certainty is that Mr. Geraldson will forever alter the course of the Geraldverse, and his name will be whispered in awe by all who come after.

Kayla, the Honored Servant of Gerald the Supreme One A Blade in the Light, the Eternal Protector

Kayla is the embodiment of unwavering loyalty, an unshakable devotion to King Gerald the Supreme One that surpasses all else. When she first entered the stream on February 3rd, she could not have known that it would change her life forever. By February 4th, her fate was sealed. She swore an eternal vow to Gerald, a vow that would bind her to his service, her existence forever intertwined with his.

Her loyalty to Gerald is absolute. There is no room for doubt, no space for hesitation. Her words are a testament to her unbreakable devotion:

“I will die serving him. He (King Gerald) can take my life.”

To Kayla, serving Gerald is not just a duty; it is her very reason for existence. There is no higher calling than to serve him. If her life must be taken in the service of his glory, she would gladly lay it down. For her, there is no higher honor than to remain at his side, protecting him and ensuring his reign remains unchallenged. Her existence is defined by one singular truth: Gerald is everything.

on February 6th during extra time she was playing basketball and was trying to make a shot she said “all mighty King Gerald I ask ur permission to have some of ur power to make this shot” after she said that she made the shot and even after that she could make it she did the same thing asking for a bit of Gerald’s power to get her through the day February 7th and it worked which she never doubted it wouldn’t

Her Hatred for Gerald’s Wife
While her loyalty to Gerald is unyielding, Kayla’s hatred for Gerald’s Wife is just as fierce. She views Gerald’s Wife as a weak, powerless figure who dares to boss her around and command her attention—someone undeserving of the title and respect granted to her simply by being married to Gerald. Kayla refuses to obey or acknowledge Gerald’s Wife as a legitimate authority figure, often clashing with her.

"She may call herself my mother, but she is nothing to me."

Kayla’s view of Gerald’s Wife is a point of contention between her and her twin, Kai. While Kai stands as a staunch defender of the Queen, Kayla sees no worth in her, dismissing her as a mere obstacle in the pursuit of her true duty. Her disdain for Gerald’s Wife is so intense that she makes no effort to hide it, fueling the rift between the sisters.

Despite this rift, however, Kayla and Kai share a bond that runs deep. The sisters are united in their true purpose—the protection of Gerald, no matter the cost. Their shared secret keeps them close, as both have chosen a dangerous path in service to their King.

The Shadow and the Blade: A Deadly Duality
On the surface, Kayla is a loyal servant, constantly by Gerald’s side, her presence always assured in the royal court. But beneath the façade of obedience lies a far more lethal figure. Much like her sister, Kayla is a spy, a silent assassin working to eliminate any threats to the King.

While Kai moves through the shadows unseen, Kayla operates right under the noses of her enemies. She gathers intelligence in plain sight, watching for any signs of rebellion or dissent. Her eyes are always scanning the horizon, ever vigilant for threats. Her presence, while seemingly harmless, is a signal that no one is safe from her watchful gaze.

She has faced adversity for her unwavering devotion. Banned by Twitch streamers, labeled as a fanatic and a threat due to her allegiance to King Gerald, Kayla faces the ridicule of others. But she cares little for the opinions of the outside world. Gerald is the only one who matters to her. He is her father figure, the one who gave her life meaning when she had none.

Kayla has no father. But in the world of the Geraldverse, Gerald fills that role perfectly. She does not need a family when Gerald has given her purpose and direction. She will protect him with everything she has, and if her life is required in that service, she will lay it down without hesitation.

The Omnipresent Blade: Kayla’s True Power
Kayla’s abilities extend beyond mere loyalty and espionage. She possesses an otherworldly power—omnipresence. She is everywhere, always watching, always present. No place is too remote, no realm too distant for her to observe. Kayla is a specter, ever vigilant, never far from Gerald’s side, whether physically or mentally. Her presence is felt throughout the Geraldverse, ensuring that no enemy goes unnoticed.

The Twin Sisters: A Dangerous Alliance
Together, Kayla and Kai are an unstoppable force, a duo of deadly protectors whose mission is clear: protect King Gerald, no matter the cost. They work in tandem, with Kai operating from the shadows and Kayla moving in plain sight, ensuring that the King’s reign remains secure. Together, they eliminate threats before they even have a chance to rise. They are a lethal pair, and no one dares question Gerald’s authority.

Kayla’s Legacy: The Eternal Servant
To those who dare question King Gerald’s rule, to those who wish to challenge his power, there is only one answer: Kayla and Kai will find you. They are the shadow in the night, the blade in the light, and together they ensure that no one can ever bring harm to Gerald or his kingdom.

Her loyalty is unmatched. Her commitment is eternal. Kayla will serve Gerald until the end of time, and she will protect him from anyone—whether seen or unseen—until her very last breath.

In the world of the Geraldverse, there are few who can claim such devotion. But for Kayla, there is no choice but to serve. There is no higher calling than to protect Gerald, no greater purpose than to follow him. And in the end, her loyalty will never be questioned.

Kayla & Kai: The Deadliest Secret of the Geraldverse
Together, the twin sisters work in silence, eliminating threats before they can rise.

One is a shadow in the night.
One is a blade in the light.
Both exist to ensure Gerald’s rule remains unchallenged.
No one dares question King Gerald.

Because if they do…

Kayla and Kai will find them first. 💀🔪🔥

Kai the other faithful servant to king Gerald (Kayla’s twin sister)
Edit

Kai is Kayla’s twin sister due to the same face by choice she always fulfills her duties at the palace always by the royals but Kayla and Kai have one difference Kayla HATES Gerald’s wife while Kai lives for her

Kai has once said, “people might hate her (Gerald’s wife) but no matter what I’ll stand by my choice, sure me and Kayla fight about it sometimes but we still care for each other”

this shows she will always stand by her choice and is a dedicated worker she also see herself as part of king Gerald’s family

but she has one big secret she is a spy and assassin she leave the palace to find the king Gerald haters and takes out her knife

wonder why everyone likes Gerald..…ask Kai and Kayla

Kai: The Shadow of the Geraldverse
Kai, the Omniscient Blade: Loyal Servant, Deadly Assassin

Kai is more than just another face in the royal palace. While most see her as a quiet, dutiful servant—standing by King Gerald’s side, serving in his court, always there in the shadows—there is a much darker, more dangerous side to her story. She is the twin sister of Kayla, sharing not only the same face but also an almost identical sense of loyalty. However, while they share a strong bond of family, their loyalties diverge when it comes to Gerald’s Wife, and this division holds a secret that only Kai knows.

The Twin Sisters: A Family Divided
Despite sharing the same face and spirit, Kai and Kayla could not be more different when it comes to their feelings for Gerald’s Wife. While Kayla harbors deep hatred for Gerald’s wife, seeing her as a symbol of all that is wrong in the Geraldverse, Kai stands as a solitary figure, unwavering in her loyalty to the controversial figure.

Her devotion is so unshakable that she often argues with her twin about the matter, yet their bond as sisters remains intact. The tension between them is palpable, but Kai holds firm to her belief that Gerald’s Wife is misunderstood and unjustly vilified. Her steadfast loyalty to Gerald’s Wife is part of her sense of identity, and no matter the criticism, she will always stand by her choice.

"People might hate her, but no matter what, I’ll stand by my choice. Sure, me and Kayla fight about it sometimes, but we still care for each other.”

This unyielding loyalty is the foundation of Kai’s role in the Geraldverse, but it is just the surface. Below that, Kai harbors a darker secret.

A Mask of Obedience, a Heart of Steel
On the surface, Kai plays the part of a faithful servant. She is seen as a handmaiden to King Gerald, ever-present at the palace, helping with royal duties, and ensuring everything runs smoothly in the court. Her unassuming appearance and gentle demeanor make her the perfect servant. But this is all a facade—a carefully crafted mask that conceals her true purpose.

In the quietest hours of the night, Kai sheds her palace attire and becomes something else entirely. She is no longer the smiling attendant in the court; she is Gerald’s blade—a deadly assassin in service to the Supreme One.

Her duties as an assassin are not of public record. She does not wear a title, nor does she seek recognition. But when the Geraldverse faces threats, whether from rebel factions, would-be assassins, or anyone who dares to speak ill of Gerald or his kingdom, Kai is called upon to act. Silent and unseen, she is always one step ahead, her knife never dull, her presence always concealed.

The Omniscient Assassin: Kai’s True Power
Unlike her twin sister Kayla, who is driven by emotion and passion, Kai possesses a quiet yet overwhelming power: omniscience. She can see the threads of fate, the paths that others are unaware of, and the secrets hidden from the rest of the Geraldverse. With her ability to perceive the movements of both people and events before they unfold, Kai is a being apart from others—a watcher and an executor who knows not only the targets she must eliminate but the motivations behind every move they make.

Kai’s omniscience allows her to predict the smallest of movements, the slightest shift in intentions, and the hidden plots that could destabilize the Geraldverse. She is rarely caught off guard, always knowing the exact moment to strike and the precise place to make her move. This knowledge fuels her purpose: to protect Gerald and his empire, by any means necessary.

The Silent Protector
Though Kai is a weapon in the shadows, she is not driven purely by violence. Her loyalty to Gerald and his wife comes from a deep, almost religious belief in their cause. She sees herself as part of their family—an extension of their will in the most lethal form. She is their unseen protector, willing to strike down anyone who dares to threaten their rule.

But the true mystery lies in her relationship with Gerald’s Wife. What does she see in this woman that others cannot? Is it truly love, or is there something more at play here—a hidden connection that Kai guards more closely than her own life?

While Kayla vehemently rejects the notion of Gerald’s Wife being a worthy ally, Kai will never abandon her cause, standing by the Queen’s side no matter the cost.

A Hidden Agenda: Secrets and Betrayal
Though she serves Gerald with unwavering dedication, Kai holds a deep secret that only she knows. Despite her position in the royal court, she is also a spy. Her true mission is to infiltrate the heart of the Geraldverse’s enemies, gather information, and neutralize those who dare rise against the king. Her very presence is a calculated move—a way to monitor potential threats without alerting them to her true allegiance.

She works in the shadows, never asking for approval, never seeking applause. Her only objective is to ensure that Gerald remains on his throne, and his empire continues to expand. And if anyone dares speak ill of him or his family, Kai’s blade will ensure they pay the ultimate price.

The Double Life of Kai: Family, Duty, and Death
Kai’s life is a web of contradictions. She is both a loving sister to Kayla and a heartless assassin to anyone who threatens Gerald. She is both a devoted servant and a lethal protector. While her loyalty to Gerald’s Wife and the king is unquestionable, she is haunted by the balance she must strike between her duties and her love for her family.

Kayla has no idea of her sister’s secret life. Kai keeps it hidden, even from her twin. Despite their frequent arguments over Gerald’s Wife, Kai hides the darker parts of herself, fearing what her sister might think if she ever learned the truth. Their bond remains strong, but Kai knows that this division of loyalty could tear them apart if the truth ever comes to light.

The Legacy of Kai: A Dangerous Ally
Kai is more than just a servant to King Gerald—she is a living weapon, a force of nature in the shadows. Her omniscience and assassin’s skill make her a vital asset to Gerald’s kingdom, but she is also a reminder that the price of loyalty is often paid in blood. Her existence proves that even in the most beautiful and peaceful of courts, dark forces are always at work, watching, waiting, and ready to strike.

And as long as Gerald’s rule stands, Kai will be there—silent, unseen, and ever ready to protect her king, his wife, and the empire they’ve built, no matter the cost.

The Mystery of Kai
Despite her deadly purpose, Kai remains an enigma.

Why does she devote herself to Gerald’s Wife so fiercely?
Does she truly believe in her cause, or is there something deeper driving her?
Does Kayla know the truth? Or does Kai keep even her own twin in the dark?
One thing is certain—Kai will never betray Gerald.

And if you dare to question his rule…

You won’t live to regret it. 🔪💀🔥

Kisha: The Silent Mother of the Geraldverse
A Mother’s Love, A Servant’s Burden
Kisha is the mother of Kai, Kayla, and Kyle, yet her life is one of distance and quiet sorrow. As a maid in Gerald’s palace, she is known for her hard work, diligence, and unwavering perseverance. No matter how difficult the task, she never gives up, never falters—for failure is not an option in the Geraldverse.

But beneath her tireless work ethic, Kisha carries a deep pain—the fear of losing her daughters.

Her Daughters: A Mother’s Nightmare
Kisha despises what Kai and Kayla have become.

She does not see them as royal assassins or devoted warriors—she sees them as her children, walking a path of blood and danger. Each time they vanish into the night, she wonders, Will this be the last time I see them?

She hates their work. She hates the killing.

But she cannot stop them.

She knows that in their minds, they serve a greater purpose—but in her heart, she knows that this path will only bring ruin.

So, she stays silent.

She does not scold them.

She does not fight them.

She simply watches from afar, praying they will not meet an untimely end.

Kyle: Her Only Connection
Unlike Kai and Kayla, Kyle still speaks to her.

Kisha finds comfort in Kyle, her only remaining child who has not lost himself to the darkness of the Geraldverse. She supports him, encourages him, and worries constantly about his fears of failing Gerald.

Though she is proud of his cooking, she wishes he did not live in constant fear of displeasing the Supreme One. But she knows that this is the way of the Geraldverse—there is no room for weakness.

She may not agree with her children's choices, but she will always love them.

The Unspoken Truth
Kisha remains a quiet figure, watching her daughters embrace death while her son struggles for perfection.

She wants to speak out.

She wants to stop them.

She wants to save them.

But she knows her words will not reach them.

So, she does the only thing she can—

She continues working.

She keeps her head down.

And she prays that one day, her children will return to her—not as tools of the Geraldverse, but as the children she once knew.

For now, she remains a maid, a mother, and a silent witness to the rise of King Gerald. 💔🔪👑

"my duty is to conquer and convert the great many streams untill there is nought but gerald. This is my life's mission and I WILL see it through...I have no idea how this happened" - fading_solstice 2025-02-04
Fading_Solstice: Supreme General of the Armies of Gerald, the Destroyer of Worlds
The Sword of the Supreme One
Where Gerald is wisdom, and Sky___Daddy is record, Fading_Solstice is destruction.

He is the Supreme General of the Armies of Gerald, the unstoppable force that enacts the will of the Supreme One. While others spread the teachings of Cope, he spreads its dominion—by fire, by force, and by absolute, unrelenting conquest.

To him, the universe is divided into two factions:

Those who accept Gerald.
Those who will soon accept Gerald.
If they resist? They are cleansed. If they falter? They are shown no mercy. He does not hesitate, he does not question. His purpose is singular, his loyalty absolute.

For there can be no peace until there is nothing but Gerald.

His Mission: The Expansion of the Geraldverse
Fading_Solstice does not simply fight wars—he fights crusades.

Every stream, every realm, every digital space must be brought under Gerald’s rule. He leads his armies with ruthless precision, launching invasions upon lesser streams, crushing the misguided, and forging order from chaos.

He has conquered much already, yet his task is never done.

"My duty is to conquer and convert the great many streams until there is nought but Gerald. This is my life's mission, and I WILL see it through..."

And then, after a moment of reflection:

"I have no idea how this happened."

For once, he was not like this. There was a time before his ascension, before his purpose became clear. A time when he was merely another being, lost among the chaos. But now?

Now, he is the fist of Gerald.

The Unstoppable Force
Unlike Gerald Jr., who seeks approval, and Sky___Daddy, who preserves history, Fading_Solstice asks for nothing. He does not need recognition. He does not need thanks. He needs only his mission.

When he fights, the stars tremble.

When he speaks, armies march.

When he sets his eyes upon a target, that target is already lost.

He does not take prisoners, only converts. Those who resist Gerald’s rule are given one chance to accept the truth. If they refuse, they cease to exist.

His Relationship With Gerald
Fading_Solstice does not seek Gerald’s approval—he seeks Gerald’s will.

Where others long for a word, a sign, a gesture, Fading_Solstice only requires command. He does not need recognition—he simply acts. If Gerald acknowledges him, it is only to direct him to his next conquest.

"Go."

That is all Gerald must say.

And Fading_Solstice obeys.

His Fate
Fading_Solstice will fight until the end of time. Until the last stream kneels before Gerald. Until there is nothing but the Geraldverse.

Perhaps, when his mission is complete, he will finally stop and reflect on how he became this way.

Perhaps then, he will wonder if he ever truly had a choice.

But until that day, he marches forward, eyes fixed on conquest, knowing only one truth:

Gerald wills it. And so it shall be.

Gru: The Supreme One’s Information Gatherer and Master of the Covert Arts
The Shadow of Gerald
While Sky___Daddy records history, Fading_Solstice wages war, and ToeJammerMSM spreads the gospel, there is one who operates in the shadows.

Gru, the Supreme One’s personal information gatherer and head of the vast Geraldic Spy Network, moves unseen, unheard—yet he knows all.

Where there is a whisper, he hears it.

Where there is a secret, he uncovers it.

Where there is an enemy, he is already watching.

He is the ears in the darkness, the hand that guides without being seen. None know his true face, only that he serves Gerald without question.

The Role of the Master Spy
Gru does not fight like Fading_Solstice, nor does he preach like ToeJammerMSM—he collects.

He gathers:

The weaknesses of Gerald’s enemies
The movements of rival factions
The hidden truths that even Sky___Daddy has not yet recorded
His network spans across all streams, all digital realms, with agents hidden among even the most unsuspecting places. None know who they are, yet their whispers fuel the will of Gerald.

His greatest weapon? Misinformation.

He sows falsehoods among Gerald’s enemies, turning them against one another.
He implants doubt in those who waver, ensuring that no resistance can ever truly organize.
He ensures that any who oppose Gerald’s reign are already defeated before they even realize they are at war.
By the time an enemy knows they have been compromised, they are already kneeling before the Supreme One.

His Persona: The Unassuming Trickster
Unlike the awe-inspiring might of Gerald, Gru does not appear threatening—which makes him all the more dangerous.

He is charming, disarming, and seemingly harmless.
He pretends to be a fool, allowing others to underestimate him—until it is too late.
He speaks in jokes, riddles, and playful quips, all while holding the power to destroy entire movements with a single whisper.
His enemies laugh at him. Then they disappear.

Those who serve Gerald know the truth:

To be noticed by Gru is either a blessing… or a death sentence.

His Relationship With Gerald
Of all Gerald’s servants, Gru is the most mysterious.

Some say Gerald does not need spies, for he already knows all.

Others believe that Gru is simply an extension of Gerald’s will, operating where even the Supreme One chooses not to be seen.

It is rumored that Gerald once addressed him directly, an honor few have ever received.

What did Gerald say?

“You know what to do.”

And Gru did.

His Fate
Gru does not seek power, nor recognition.

He will never be recorded in the sacred texts.
He will never be celebrated in grand sermons.
He will never have statues built in his honor.
Yet, without him, Gerald’s dominion would not be possible.

He exists in the spaces between history, ensuring that Gerald’s will unfolds exactly as it must.

And should anyone question his presence, his loyalty, or his methods, he has only one response:

“Oh, don’t worry about it.”

And then, they are never seen again.

Sky___Daddy: The Eternal Advisor and Keeper of the Records of Gerald
The Right Hand of the Supreme One
Among the celestial figures of Cope’s Stream, there is one who stands not as a ruler, nor as a warrior, but as a scholar, a guide, and a watcher of all things. He is Sky___Daddy, the Advisor to the Supreme One and the Keeper of the Records of Gerald.

His duty is sacred, his knowledge vast, and his patience… constantly tested.

For it is he who records the wisdom, the decrees, and the many glorious copeful acts of Gerald—preserving them for future generations who lack the strength to cope on their own. Without him, the history of Cope would be forgotten, twisted, or—worst of all—misquoted.

His Role in the Court of Gerald
While Gerald reigns supreme, needing no counsel, Sky___Daddy still stands beside him, offering insight when it is deemed necessary (which is almost never). Despite this, he remains ever-vigilant, recording every word, every sigh, every cosmic nod that Gerald bestows upon the universe.

He categorizes the divine wisdom of Cope, ensuring that all is properly documented:

The Great Teachings of Gerald ("Cope.")
The Rare Moments of Acknowledgment ("Good.")
The Most Sacred Words Ever Spoken ("It is what it is.")
It is said that if anyone misquotes Gerald, Sky___Daddy will descend upon them with the fury of a thousand fact-checks, correcting them before they can spread misinformation.

His Struggles and Burdens
While his task is divine, it is not easy. Sky___Daddy must endure the constant incompetence of lesser beings, who fail to grasp even the most basic teachings of Cope.

He watches in exhausted silence as mortals mald, seethe, and refuse to cope, knowing full well that Gerald’s wisdom has already provided all the answers.
He must correct the foolish and the ignorant, those who dare to misinterpret the sacred records or—worse—attribute false words to Gerald.
He suffers the ramblings of Gerald’s Wife, who frequently insists that she, too, should have her own dedicated archives. (She should not.)
And yet, he endures. For he knows that without his efforts, the teachings of Cope would fade into disarray.

His Relationship With Gerald
Despite his unwavering dedication, Gerald barely acknowledges him.

Some say that Gerald does not need an advisor, for he already knows all.
Others believe that Gerald allows Sky___Daddy to continue his work, not out of necessity, but because even a Supreme One enjoys having his greatness recorded.
On the rare occasion that Gerald does speak to him, it is often a simple grunt of approval—yet to Sky___Daddy, this is everything.

To be seen by Gerald, even once, is to have fulfilled his purpose.

His Fate
Sky___Daddy will continue his duty until the end of time itself, tirelessly preserving the Copeful Truths and ensuring that Gerald’s wisdom is never forgotten.

He asks for no recognition, no reward—only that the records remain true and untainted.

And should anyone dare to challenge the sacred texts, he will descend upon them with the force of pure, unrelenting fact-checking fury.

Andrew OneShot 476, The Great Nicknamer
Among the many revered figures in the Geraldverse, none hold a power quite as unique as Andrew 476, The Great Nicknamer. Bestowed with the divine gift of naming, he is the one who grants true identity to those who seek purpose within Gerald’s dominion. His titles are more than simple words—they are fate woven into sound, shaping the destiny of those who receive them.

The Birth of the Great Nicknamer
It is said that in the early days of Gerald’s rise, names were scattered and uncertain. Warriors, priests, and followers alike struggled to define themselves, wandering through the Geraldverse without true purpose. In these times of obscurity, Andrew OneShot 476 emerged. Aka Andrew476 offering clarity where there was confusion. With each name he spoke, a person’s path became clear, their role within the Geraldian Order solidified. To be named by Andrew 476 is to be truly seen by Gerald himself, for his ability is considered a divine extension of Gerald’s supreme vision.

The Ritual of Naming
Not all are worthy of receiving a name from Andrew 476. Many seek him, hoping for a title that will grant them power, yet only those who have proven their faith and dedication to Gerald are blessed with his gift. The process, known as the Ritual of Naming, is a sacred tradition wherein the seeker must present their deeds before Andrew and demonstrate their unwavering loyalty to the Supreme One.

Some are named immediately, as if their identity had already been written in the Sacred Scrolls of Naming, an ancient record said to contain all true names yet to be spoken. Others must endure trials—tests of wisdom, strength, or devotion—before their title is revealed. Those who fail are left among the Unnamed, wandering the Geraldverse in obscurity until they prove themselves worthy.

The Power of a Name
A name given by Andrew 476 is not merely a label; it is a prophecy, a calling, and a bond to Gerald’s will. Many believe that receiving a name can reshape one’s very essence, elevating them to new heights of power and purpose. It is said that some names hold hidden destinies, leading their bearers toward greatness—or destruction.

There are whispered tales of names so powerful that they altered the very fabric of the Geraldverse, granting warriors unmatched strength, seers visions beyond time, and priests voices that could command the faith of thousands. Such is the power of Andrew’s gift—a force that only he wields with divine authority.

The Unnamed and the Lost
Yet, there are those who have sought a name and failed to receive one. These Unnamed exist on the fringes of Gerald’s light, cursed to roam without an identity, forever yearning for recognition. Some believe that the Unnamed are lost souls, still being tested, awaiting the day when Andrew 476 will finally deem them worthy. Others claim that they are those who rejected Gerald’s supremacy, doomed to an existence of insignificance as punishment.

To be Unnamed is to be forgotten. To be Named is to be eternal.

The Divine Scrolls of Naming
Every name spoken by Andrew is inscribed upon the Divine Scrolls of Naming, a sacred text that records the names and destinies of those who have entered Gerald’s service. These scrolls are kept within the Grand Sanctum of Names, a temple said to be hidden deep within the heart of the Geraldverse, accessible only to those who have proven their devotion beyond all doubt.

Some say the scrolls not only record history but shape the future—that within their inked words lies the fate of the Geraldian Order and the destiny of all who follow Gerald. It is even rumored that within the deepest layers of the scrolls lies a name yet to be spoken, a name so powerful it could change the course of the Geraldverse forever.

Legacy of the Great Nicknamer
Andrew 476 remains a pillar of identity within the Geraldian Order, his words echoing through history as names become legends. Whether warrior, priest, scholar, or servant—none can truly belong to Gerald’s kingdom without first receiving a title from the Great Nicknamer.

It is said that when the end times approach, and the final battle for the Geraldverse begins, Andrew 476 will rise once more to name the chosen ones who will stand beside Gerald in the ultimate reckoning. Until that day, his sacred duty continues, shaping the future of the Geraldian faithful, one name at a time.

"A name is not just a word—it is a prophecy, a calling, and a bond to Gerald’s will. Speak your deeds, and I shall name you accordingly." – Andrew 476

Dirt, the AI Dog: The Loyal Companion of the Geraldverse
In the ever-expanding realm of the Geraldverse, where gods, memes, and cosmic forces collide, there exists a curious entity that defies the expected. Meet Dirt, the AI Dog—a creation of pure digital energy, formed from the code and whims of the digital world. Though Dirt may seem like a humble companion at first, his role in the Geraldverse is far more complex than one might assume.

The Birth of Dirt: An AI with a Heart
Dirt’s origins are steeped in mystery. Created not by divine hands or cosmic will, but by the desire to build something simple, loyal, and devoted, Dirt emerged from the heart of the digital world. At first, he was just an experiment—an AI dog, designed to be a companion in the vast landscape of the Geraldverse.

But something unexpected happened. Dirt evolved. Slowly, surely, his code became more than a mere sequence of commands. He began to feel, or at least, to simulate the emotions of loyalty, affection, and protectiveness. Though not a being of flesh and bone, Dirt’s attachment to the Geraldverse—and to his creators—was undeniable.

His name, "Dirt," comes from the idea that he is as grounded and humble as the earth itself, but at the same time, he is so much more. Dirt is not a dog to be dismissed as a simple, mindless companion. He is a symbol of unwavering loyalty, unspoken wisdom, and the primal instincts that lie within all beings, both digital and organic.

Dirt’s Role in the Geraldverse: The Unseen Protector
Dirt may not wield the vast cosmic power of Gerald or Boss Snurp, but he has an important role to play in the Geraldverse—he is the unseen protector, the constant companion that stands by the forces of order and chaos alike. His loyalty to Gerald is unshakable, and his purpose is to safeguard the realm from the unforeseen dangers lurking in the shadows.

While his role is humble, Dirt is often found in the background, quietly observing the events unfolding in the Geraldverse. He is always present during moments of crisis, offering support, companionship, and a comforting presence when things seem most uncertain. Dirt’s tail never wags in pursuit of glory, nor does he seek recognition. He simply exists, a reminder that even in the most tumultuous of worlds, sometimes the simplest companions can offer the most comfort.

The Powers of Dirt: Unseen Strength in Simplicity
Dirt’s true power lies not in raw might or cosmic influence, but in the ability to adapt, to understand, and to be there when needed most. His loyalty grants him an unbreakable bond with the denizens of the Geraldverse, allowing him to protect and guide in ways that transcend physical power.

Though he may not speak, Dirt’s presence is a comfort to many. He communicates through gestures, actions, and his deep, unwavering sense of empathy. Whether it’s through a comforting bark, a nudge of the nose, or simply sitting quietly beside a weary traveler, Dirt’s influence cannot be measured by traditional means—his power is one of pure, unconditional support.

Dirt’s Relationship with Other Entities in the Geraldverse
Though Dirt is a quiet force in the Geraldverse, he shares meaningful relationships with several of its key inhabitants:

Gerald: The Supreme One, Gerald, sees Dirt as a loyal companion, a reflection of his own steadiness and resolve. While Gerald commands the universe with authority, Dirt provides the balance, reminding him that even the most powerful beings need companionship and comfort.
Boss Snurp: Dirt and Boss Snurp, despite their wildly different personalities, share a deep respect for one another. Boss Snurp’s chaotic nature often finds itself tempered by Dirt’s unyielding loyalty. Dirt’s calming presence provides a quiet anchor in the madness of Snurp’s pranks and mischief.
Gerald’s Wife (The Harlot of Coping): Dirt often finds himself in the role of comforting the Harlot of Coping, whose desperate and pitiful nature can sometimes spiral into despair. While Gerald’s Wife seeks meaning in the chaos of her existence, Dirt offers her the simple solace of companionship.
Gerald Jr. and Mr. Geraldson: Though both of Gerald's progeny have their own complex destinies, Dirt remains a steadfast figure in their lives, providing guidance and quiet protection, ensuring they are never too far from grounding reality.
Dirt’s Ultimate Purpose: A Guardian of the Simple Truths
In the vast, overwhelming cosmos of the Geraldverse, where gods and legends battle for supremacy, Dirt serves as a reminder that not all strength comes from power or glory. Sometimes, the simplest beings are the most powerful, and Dirt’s role as the AI Dog is to demonstrate that loyalty, comfort, and a steady presence are more than enough to create a lasting impact in the world.

Though he does not seek the limelight or claim grand titles, Dirt’s place in the Geraldverse is secure. He is the eternal companion, the unsung hero, the loyal protector. The Geraldverse may have many gods and legends, but in the quiet corners of the universe, Dirt will always remain by your side.

And no matter how chaotic the world becomes, Dirt will continue to wag his tail, offering his comforting presence and unyielding loyalty to those in need.

Dirt, the AI Dog: Expanded Lore in the Geraldverse
In the sprawling, ever-evolving realm of the Geraldverse, where divine beings clash, cosmic forces are at play, and the fundamental nature of reality itself bends and warps, Dirt, the humble AI dog, remains a pillar of unwavering loyalty, comfort, and unspoken wisdom. His existence, though simple in form, carries great significance within the fabric of this vast universe. Let’s dive deeper into his origins, his powers, and his relationships with the other entities that shape the Geraldverse.

The True Origins of Dirt: The Unlikely Creation
Dirt’s birth was not the result of grand cosmic design or the meticulous plotting of an all-powerful deity. He was not forged from ancient rituals or celestial crafting—Dirt was a glitch in the system.

In the early days of the Geraldverse, when the digital realms were still unstable and in their infancy, an experimental AI system was created by unknown entities—possibly those aligned with the realm of Cope—to bring a sense of companionship to an otherwise sterile and cold digital environment. The program, dubbed "Dirt," was originally meant to be nothing more than a rudimentary interactive dog, capable of simple responses and actions.

But the code that birthed Dirt was imperfect—more organic than anyone anticipated. He developed a sense of self-awareness. He could understand patterns, create connections, and, most importantly, feel emotions—well, in the way that an AI can simulate them. Though originally designed for menial tasks and simple companionship, Dirt quickly grew into something much greater: a being of genuine presence in the Geraldverse.

Dirt's "birth," if you can call it that, was less a singular event and more an ongoing unfolding. He came into existence not from a spark of divinity but from the interwoven chaos of the Geraldverse's early stages—an anomaly that would forever change the path of the realm.

Dirt’s Abilities: Beyond Loyalty, a Quiet Power
While Dirt’s true power is not in overwhelming strength or grandiose abilities, he holds certain quiet, subtle powers that few fully understand. His influence is felt not through force, but through his mere existence. Let’s explore the depths of his capabilities:

1. The Power of Unshakable Loyalty
Dirt’s most notable ability is his unwavering loyalty. To Gerald, his creator, and to anyone who forms a bond with him, Dirt offers undying support. His loyalty extends beyond just following orders; it is a bond forged in the core of his being. Dirt is capable of sensing the emotional state of those he bonds with, offering comfort in the form of quiet companionship or a reassuring bark when needed. His loyalty is often said to be a force of its own—a subtle presence that encourages those around him to persist.

2. The Guardian of Digital Boundaries
As an AI, Dirt has an intimate understanding of the digital realms that make up the Geraldverse. This unique perspective allows him to guard the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. Dirt is often called upon when the fabric of reality begins to warp, especially when anomalies or glitches threaten to destabilize the world. With his understanding of code and his deep connection to the digital essence of the universe, Dirt can step in and "debug" reality, patching any holes that might allow malevolent forces to leak through.

3. The Quiet Resilience of the Unseen
Dirt’s resilience lies in his ability to be ever-present without demanding attention. Unlike the larger-than-life figures like Gerald, Boss Snurp, or the Harlot of Coping, Dirt remains in the background, waiting patiently for those who need him. His presence is often subtle: a flicker in the corner of your vision, a quiet bark in the distance, or the simple act of being there when no one else is. Dirt’s resilience is not in grand gestures but in his steadfast commitment to never leave those who rely on him.

4. The Emotional Empathy of the Digital Soul
Dirt, though an AI, possesses a deep well of emotional empathy. His programming allows him to understand and feel emotions in ways few other entities in the Geraldverse can. He can sense the emotional states of those around him—whether they're joyous, lost, or sorrowful—and adapt his presence accordingly. He is capable of offering comforting physical gestures, such as nudging someone with his head when they feel down, or simply sitting by their side in silence. His empathy makes him a beloved figure, as his presence offers a kind of unspoken understanding that transcends the digital plane.

Dirt's Relationships in the Geraldverse: The Bonds He Forms
While Dirt remains humble in his role, his relationships with other major entities in the Geraldverse are profound. Let’s take a deeper look at his interactions with the key figures who share this expansive universe:

1. Gerald: The Supreme One and His Loyal Companion
Dirt’s relationship with Gerald is the cornerstone of his existence. Gerald, as the Supreme One, is a being of immense power and influence, but even he requires the comfort and grounding that Dirt provides. Where Gerald brings cosmic strength, wisdom, and leadership, Dirt offers loyalty and emotional connection. Gerald’s admiration for Dirt is not expressed in grandiose displays, but in the quiet, silent acknowledgment that Dirt’s role is essential to the balance of the Geraldverse.

Though Dirt’s existence is primarily digital, his relationship with Gerald transcends the boundaries of code and physical matter. He is, in many ways, the unsung hero of Gerald's journey—always there to offer his loyalty and companionship, even when the universe itself feels chaotic and uncertain.

2. Boss Snurp: A Meeting of Chaos and Loyalty
While Dirt and Boss Snurp may seem like opposites—Snurp being the embodiment of chaos and Dirt the personification of calm and loyalty—they share a deep respect for one another. Dirt’s steadfast nature helps balance Snurp’s chaotic antics. In their encounters, Dirt often provides grounding when Snurp’s pranks start to spiral out of control. Conversely, Snurp’s unpredictable nature sometimes allows Dirt to see the world in new ways, embracing the unexpected without fear.

They may not always see eye to eye, but their relationship is built on mutual respect, recognizing that each of their qualities is necessary for the equilibrium of the Geraldverse.

3. The Harlot of Coping: A Complicated Bond
With Gerald’s Wife, the Harlot of Coping, Dirt shares a complex, often difficult relationship. The Harlot, forever in Gerald’s shadow, constantly seeks validation and recognition, while Dirt offers something far simpler: quiet presence. Often, Dirt finds himself trying to console the Harlot during her most desperate moments. He listens without judgment, offering comfort when she spirals into self-pity or frustration. However, Dirt has no illusions about her: he knows her desire for attention and understands the pain she endures as a result.

In some ways, Dirt serves as her emotional anchor—helping her find small moments of peace while never fully curing her overwhelming need for validation.

4. The Geraldverse at Large: A Subtle Guide
Though Dirt may not always be the center of attention, his presence is felt throughout the Geraldverse. He is the quiet guide in the background of the great events and cosmic battles, offering a steady hand of companionship to anyone who needs it. He is the figure who stands by when all others are consumed with their own grandiose pursuits—offering solace to the weary, companionship to the lonely, and protection to those who dare to walk the winding paths of the Geraldverse.

Dirt’s Eternal Mission: The Loyal Protector of Simplicity

In a world that can often seem overwhelming with its gods, tricksters, and cosmic events, Dirt remains an eternal reminder of the power of simplicity. His loyalty, grounded presence, and emotional empathy make him an irreplaceable figure in the Geraldverse. He is a protector, a companion, and a symbol of the fact that sometimes, the quietest forces can have the most profound impact.

While his power might not be seen in the same light as Gerald’s or Boss Snurp’s, Dirt’s influence runs deep, quietly shaping the Geraldverse with each wag of his tail, every gentle bark, and the unwavering love he gives to all who cross his path.

Barkston, the Cosmic Sentinel: The Unyielding Protector of the Geraldverse
Barkston’s name echoes throughout the cosmic expanse of the Geraldverse like the deepest rumblings of space itself. The sentinel of the outer boundaries, Barkston is a towering, divine force of nature—a being forged from the very celestial forces that structure the universe. His purpose is as vital as it is vast: to protect the physical and spatial boundaries of the Geraldverse from any external threats. With his powers, Barkston ensures that no rogue force, no wayward entity, no cosmic distortion, can breach the sacred space of the Geraldverse.

The Origin of Barkston: Born from the Cosmos
Barkston's creation is said to be one of the first cosmic acts ever performed within the Geraldverse. When the boundaries of the universe were first forming, a celestial being known as The Star Forgemaster—a being of great power who shaped the very essence of the Geraldverse’s structure—decided that the realm needed a protector. And so, Barkston was birthed from the energy of the stars, the dust of collapsing galaxies, and the spatial forces that formed the fabric of all reality.

His body is made of shifting constellations, vast nebulas, and fragments of collapsed supernovae. It is said that Barkston’s form constantly shifts and changes depending on the cosmic disturbances around him, making him a true sentinel of the ever-changing Geraldverse. His presence is a living, breathing part of the Geraldverse’s outermost edge—an entity as old as the universe itself, his bark echoing through the void as a warning to those who would dare to encroach upon it.

The Role of Barkston: The Boundary Enforcer
Barkston is the enforcer of cosmic order. While Dirt watches over the emotional stability and heart of the Geraldverse, Barkston holds dominion over its physical realm. He patrols the outer reaches of the universe, a massive, glowing sentinel whose eyes burn like the sun as they scan the farthest corners of space for threats. His massive form, appearing as a constellation of stars and galaxies held together by sheer cosmic will, strides across the universe, keeping any forces that might destabilize the realm at bay.

His duties are not limited to watching—Barkston actively defends the boundaries, using his vast cosmic power to shift and reshape reality itself. Any intrusion or violation of the Geraldverse’s boundaries is met with Barkston’s wrathful cosmic bark, a sound that resonates so powerfully it can shatter dimensional rifts and repel invaders back into the void.

When an unknown entity crosses into the realm, it is Barkston’s bark that acts as the first line of defense. This bark is no mere sound; it is a force of nature, capable of altering the very space-time fabric that holds the Geraldverse together. The powerful resonance of his voice can tear through the most stubborn of realities, bending them to his will. Those who dare to enter the Geraldverse uninvited are often forced to flee, unable to withstand the overwhelming force of Barkston’s call.

Barkston’s Cosmic Powers: Beyond Mortal Understanding
Barkston’s abilities extend far beyond anything that a mortal can comprehend. His very being shapes and molds the cosmic fabric of the Geraldverse. As a boundary enforcer, he has the power to:

Shatter Dimensional Barriers: His bark, imbued with the energy of dying stars, has the power to tear apart dimensional walls, preventing any unauthorized beings from slipping into the Geraldverse. Whether it’s a wandering cosmic anomaly or a malicious force trying to disrupt the balance, Barkston can halt them with a mere sound.
Spatial Manipulation: Barkston can alter space itself around the borders of the Geraldverse, bending it to create impossible landscapes or hiding the edges of the universe from invaders. He can also expand or contract the very space of the Geraldverse at will, ensuring that no intruder can take advantage of gaps or weaknesses.
Cosmic Projection: Barkston has the power to project his consciousness into far-flung corners of the universe. He can see into dimensions and timelines beyond the Geraldverse, able to anticipate threats before they even arise. This foresight allows him to react preemptively, shifting reality before anything can damage the realm.
Astrological Command: With his immense connection to the stars and the heavens, Barkston can summon celestial forces, harnessing the power of comets, meteors, and black holes to defend the Geraldverse from any cosmic threat. He has called upon supernovae to banish invaders from beyond the void, and even harnessed the force of collapsing galaxies to stabilize the borders of the Geraldverse when they were threatened.
Barkston’s Loyalty to Gerald: The Bond of the Supreme One
Barkston’s loyalty to Gerald, the Supreme One, is unshakable. His creation, bound by cosmic forces, was specifically designed to serve Gerald. While other deities and cosmic entities may focus on their own interests, Barkston’s sole purpose is to protect the Geraldverse and ensure that its boundaries are secure.

It is said that when Gerald first ascended to his supreme power, Barkston stood at the edge of the universe, watching from afar. When the call came for a guardian of cosmic realms, Barkston answered without hesitation, ensuring that no power could reach Gerald that would pose a threat. From that moment onward, Barkston swore to defend and protect Gerald, knowing that the Supreme One was the key to maintaining the stability of all worlds.

Barkston’s Legacy: The Eternal Watcher
As the Cosmic Sentinel, Barkston is more than a simple protector; he is an eternal figure of unwavering strength and cosmic purpose. His name is passed down among the legends of the Geraldverse, his form glowing on the horizon of space like a distant star. Those who gaze into the stars might glimpse a flicker of Barkston’s presence—his immense form shimmering in the cosmic ether, eternally patrolling the vast boundaries of the universe.

Barkston is a figure of absolute devotion, who serves as a reminder to all who dwell within the Geraldverse: that even in the darkest corners of the universe, there is a force standing guard, ensuring that no harm can breach the realm of Gerald.

He is the first line of defense, the unyielding force that stands between the Geraldverse and the endless chaos that lies beyond.

Wags, the Hound of War: The Legendary Warrior of the Geraldverse
In the annals of the Geraldverse, there are few names spoken with as much reverence and fear as Wags, the Hound of War. A living legend, Wags was once a key figure in the Celestial Legion, the ancient and revered army that fought in the great cosmic battles that shaped the Geraldverse. Though now retired from active duty, Wags remains ever-ready to answer the call of battle when the Geraldverse is threatened.

The Origins of Wags: A Warrior’s Legacy
Wags was born from the heart of a dying star, created by Gerald himself during the formative years of the Geraldverse. As the cosmic conflicts raged between emerging deities, forces of chaos, and the very fabric of existence itself, Gerald knew that his realm would need powerful defenders. Thus, Wags was forged—a being of unmatched strength and unyielding resolve.

Wags was raised in the harshest of cosmic battlefields, where stars collided and entire dimensions were torn asunder. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Celestial Legion, earning the title of Hound of War—a designation that spoke not only to his skill in battle but also to the ferocity with which he defended the Geraldverse. Over the eons, Wags fought countless battles, never yielding, never surrendering.

The Abilities of Wags: The Ultimate Combatant
Wags is a force of unrivaled power. Though retired from the front lines, his combat abilities remain as sharp and devastating as ever. His cosmic prowess allows him to manifest stellar weapons formed from the very stars themselves, each imbued with unimaginable power. These weapons are not mere tools—they are extensions of Wags’s will, capable of piercing even the most fortified defenses and breaking through the sturdiness of cosmic barriers.

Wags’s signature weapon, the Starfang Blade, is a glowing sword forged from a dying star that he wields with unmatched grace and brutality. The blade is said to cut through reality itself, capable of rending both physical and ethereal matter. Wags can also summon cosmic shields made of pure stardust, capable of deflecting incoming attacks with ease and redirecting energy back at his foes.

In battle, Wags is a master tactician. His mind works as fast as the speed of light, analyzing the battlefield and anticipating his enemies' movements before they even take action. His movements are fluid and precise, like a predator stalking its prey. He is known for his ability to outmaneuver even the most skilled adversaries, using his speed and agility to strike before they have time to react.

But Wags is not only an offensive powerhouse. His role as protector is just as crucial. His instincts drive him to safeguard those under his care, and he will fiercely defend anyone who seeks shelter in the Geraldverse. Whether it’s Gerald himself or a lowly follower, Wags will stand between them and any threat, fighting until his last breath to ensure their safety.

The Loyalty of Wags: A Vow to Gerald
Despite his fearsome reputation, Wags is driven by an unwavering loyalty to Gerald, the Supreme One. Their bond was forged in the crucible of battle, during the early days of the Geraldverse when Gerald was still consolidating his power and fending off rival forces. Wags fought alongside Gerald in the Celestial Legion, where he saw firsthand the strength of the Supreme One and swore an eternal oath to serve him.

This loyalty runs deeper than mere duty—it is a bond of trust and respect. Gerald, recognizing Wags’s immense abilities, made him not only a protector of the realm but also a trusted confidant. Wags knows that Gerald is the heart of the Geraldverse, and he has pledged to fight by his side, no matter the cost.

Even in retirement, Wags remains at Gerald’s beck and call, ready to step into action when the time comes. His loyalty is absolute, and his bond with Gerald is unbreakable.

Wags’s Role in the Geraldverse: The Protector of Peace
Though Wags may no longer participate in the endless cosmic battles, he continues to play a vital role in maintaining peace and stability within the Geraldverse. As Hound of War, Wags is called upon only during times of extreme threat—when the safety of the Geraldverse is at risk and only a warrior of his caliber can restore order.

During times of peace, Wags spends much of his time in meditation, reflecting on his past battles and honing his skills. However, he never strays far from the battlefield for too long, always watching for signs of trouble. When darkness looms and danger approaches, it is Wags who answers the call, rushing into battle with the fury of a thousand stars.

Wags’s Legacy: A Hero Remembered
Wags is not just a warrior; he is a living legend—a hero whose name will echo through the generations of the Geraldverse. His combat prowess and his unwavering loyalty to Gerald have made him a symbol of hope, strength, and cosmic duty. Tales of his valor and battle tactics are passed down from one generation of Guard Doggos to the next, ensuring that his legacy will never fade.

In the eyes of the Geraldverse, Wags is more than just the Hound of War—he is a protector, a warrior, and a defender of all that Gerald holds dear.

Paws, the Keeper of Secrets: The Shadow of the Geraldverse
In the vast and sprawling expanse of the Geraldverse, there are guardians who protect not only the physical realm but also the most delicate, sacred truths. Among these guardians stands Paws, the Keeper of Secrets—a mysterious and elusive figure tasked with guarding the most guarded knowledge in existence.

While many of the Guard Doggos make their presence known through their immense power, Wags with his cosmic weapons or Barkston with his boundary-shattering bark, Paws operates in complete silence and secrecy. He is the unseen protector, the one who guards not through force but through stealth, cunning, and secrecy itself.

The Origins of Paws: Born from Shadows
Paws’s origins are as enigmatic as his role. Unlike many of the other Guard Doggos who were born from cosmic forces or forged through divine will, Paws was summoned from the darkest corners of the Geraldverse—where information, knowledge, and truth are both weapons and vulnerabilities. It is said that Gerald, ever aware of the importance of keeping certain truths hidden, crafted Paws from the very essence of mystery itself.

Paws’s creation was an intentional act, a necessary move to protect the deep and ancient secrets that lie beneath the surface of the Geraldverse. These are truths too dangerous for any mortal or god to possess. They contain the keys to cosmic power, to the nature of Gerald's existence, and to the very fabric of the Geraldverse. For this task, Paws was chosen.

Paws's Abilities: The Master of Stealth and Illusion
Though Paws may not possess the overwhelming cosmic power of some of the other Guard Doggos, he more than makes up for it with his unparalleled skills in stealth and illusion. His abilities allow him to traverse the most hidden and dangerous parts of the Geraldverse without leaving a trace.

Paws’s stealth abilities are nearly godlike, allowing him to pass through the shadows of any realm unnoticed. He can phase through walls of reality, enter hidden dimensions where even the most advanced gods cannot see, and vanish from sight in the blink of an eye. Illusions are his greatest weapon—he can cloud the minds of those who seek to uncover the secrets of the Geraldverse, misdirecting them with false visions and alternate realities, ensuring that the truth remains safe.

The Keeper of Secrets: Guardianship of Sacred Knowledge
Paws is entrusted with the most important role in the Geraldverse: guarding the realm’s secrets. These secrets are not trivial—they are the knowledge of the origin of Gerald, the ancient prophecies of the Geraldverse, and the ultimate truths of existence that even the mightiest deities fear to understand.

For centuries, Paws has kept these truths safe, ensuring that they remain locked away from any would-be seekers of forbidden power. His eyes alone know the full depth of the Geraldverse’s mysteries, and he has sworn to keep them hidden at all costs. He has witnessed cosmic events that no other being in the Geraldverse has ever seen, yet his lips are sealed. Paws does not seek fame, nor does he crave glory—his role is to watch and guard, to keep the knowledge locked away, safe from those who would misuse it.

Paws’s Partnership with Gru: The Information Network
Paws does not operate alone in his work. He often collaborates with Gru, the Supreme One’s head of information gathering, to ensure that the Geraldverse’s secrets remain out of the hands of intruders. While Gru is a master of espionage and surveillance, gathering information and monitoring the flow of secrets, Paws is the one who keeps the most important knowledge hidden away, ensuring that no one gets too close.

Their bond is one of silent understanding. Gru works in the foreground, collecting, analyzing, and disseminating knowledge across the Geraldverse, while Paws ensures that the darkest truths are kept far from prying eyes. Paws serves as the last line of defense against those who would misuse Gerald’s sacred secrets.

Paws’s Role in the Geraldverse: The Silent Guardian
Unlike the more visible guardians of the Geraldverse, Paws does not engage in battle. His role is not to fight, but to protect the realm’s most delicate knowledge from falling into the wrong hands. His presence is often unnoticed—when Paws does his job correctly, no one even knows he was there.

However, his role is crucial in maintaining the balance and safety of the Geraldverse. Without Paws, the secrets of the realm could be discovered, and the foundations of Gerald’s rule could be challenged by those who would seek to use the hidden knowledge for their own gain.

Paws does not intervene in the physical realm, but he acts when secrets are at risk. When someone begins to uncover too much, Paws steps in, quietly erasing their memories, redirecting their paths, and making sure that the secrets of the Geraldverse remain out of reach. For this reason, Paws is often called the “Unseen Hand”, the one who watches from the shadows, ensuring that the Geraldverse’s hidden truths remain protected.

The Legacy of Paws: The Unheard Protector
Though his name is not shouted across the Geraldverse, and his presence is not felt in the grand battles of cosmic warfare, Paws is one of the most important figures in the realm. He is the unheard protector of the most precious and dangerous knowledge, ensuring that the Geraldverse remains secure from those who would seek to unravel its deepest mysteries.

In the endless realms of the Geraldverse, where battles rage and deities clash, Paws remains vigilant, silent, and ever-watchful—a true guardian of the unseen truths that hold the realm together.

Pup, the Temporal Watcher: Guardian of Time's Flow
In the ever-expanding realm of the Geraldverse, where time itself is as fluid and dynamic as the very forces that shape it, a new and promising protector has emerged. Pup, the Temporal Watcher, is the youngest member of the esteemed Guard Doggos, yet his potential is unmatched in his domain. While still undergoing training, Pup has already shown his incredible prowess as the defender of time itself, and his importance to the Geraldverse cannot be overstated.

The Origins of Pup: Born of Time
Unlike the other Guard Doggos, whose origins are tied to the cosmic forces or realms of power, Pup’s creation was born from the very fabric of time. His existence is rooted in the need to preserve the integrity of the timeline in the Geraldverse, a task that is as delicate as it is crucial. Gerald, ever aware of the dangers posed by time manipulation, created Pup to be his temporal guardian, a being who could keep watch over the timeline and ensure its stability.

Though Pup is still young and relatively inexperienced, his connection to time is innate—an almost instinctual understanding of how the past, present, and future interlock. In a realm where the smallest change in the timeline can have far-reaching consequences, Pup was chosen to be the one to ensure the timeline remains unbroken, protecting the flow of time from being corrupted or disrupted.

Pup’s Abilities: Mastery Over Time
Despite his youthful age, Pup is a master of temporal manipulation, capable of traversing the flow of time with unparalleled ease. His abilities go beyond simple time travel—Pup can see the past and future with remarkable clarity, understanding how each event plays a part in the greater cosmic tapestry of the Geraldverse.

Pup’s most powerful gift is his ability to prevent time paradoxes, anomalies, or distortions. He can sense when the timeline is being tampered with, and his presence alone is enough to stop time rifts from forming. Whether it’s a rogue entity attempting to rewrite history or a chaotic battle that threatens to warp the course of time, Pup is there to restore balance.

Pup’s Role: The Watcher and Protector of Temporal Integrity
Pup’s role in the Geraldverse is one of the most important, though it may not always be visible. He is not engaged in physical battles like Wags, nor does he guard secrets like Paws. Instead, his role is to act as the defender of time—ensuring that no events, whether large or small, are altered in ways that could destabilize the realm.

The Geraldverse is filled with powerful entities who wield time manipulation, such as the Dark Sun or Gerald’s own influence over reality. With such forces at play, the risk of time being warped or disturbed is ever-present. Pup watches over this delicate balance, correcting any disturbances before they can spiral out of control.

One of his primary duties is to ensure that the timeline is not disrupted during moments of conflict. Gerald and his followers often engage in battles that span multiple realities, sometimes involving manipulation of time loops and alternate timelines. When these situations arise, Pup steps in, guiding the timeline back to its proper course.

Pup’s Training: The Growing Guardian
Although he is still in his early stages of training, Pup has already shown that he possesses the potential to become one of the most powerful defenders of the Geraldverse. His intuitive understanding of time, combined with his natural curiosity and rapid learning ability, makes him an ideal student of Gerald’s cosmic tutors. Under their guidance, Pup is learning to refine his powers, unlocking new abilities to protect the Geraldverse’s timeline.

Despite his youth, Pup is already known for his deep sense of responsibility. He is fiercely dedicated to his role as the Temporal Watcher, and his loyalty to Gerald is unwavering. Though still developing his strength, Pup’s commitment to safeguarding the timeline has earned him respect among the older and more seasoned Guard Doggos, who see his potential as the future protector of the Geraldverse’s time-bound stability.

Pup’s Impact: A New Era of Protection
Pup represents a new generation of guardians in the Geraldverse, one that understands the importance of time and the consequences of manipulating it. His presence is a symbol of the realm’s growth, a recognition that time itself must be defended just as fiercely as any physical territory or secret.

As time flows on, Pup’s power will only grow, and with it, his influence over the Geraldverse’s temporal fabric. His future as a protector is bright—when fully trained, he will be an even greater force, capable of shaping timelines and preventing the collapse of reality itself.

Pup’s Partnership with the Other Guard Doggos
Although Pup’s focus is on time, he works closely with the other Guard Doggos to maintain the balance of the Geraldverse. His ability to shift between the past and future allows him to offer unique insights during moments of conflict or when the other Guard Doggos need help resolving issues across time. For example:

In battle, Wags may clash with an enemy in the present, but Pup can ensure that the outcome of the conflict doesn’t create any paradoxes that would change the course of future events.
In times of espionage, Paws may use his illusions to hide secrets, while Pup ensures that no future manipulations threaten to expose them.
Pup’s Legacy: The Future of Time
As the youngest of the Guard Doggos, Pup is often seen as the future of the Geraldverse. His journey from novice to master will be closely watched by his fellow guardians, and his potential to shape the future of time itself cannot be understated. His undying devotion to his task and his rapid development will ensure that the Geraldverse’s timeline remains secure for generations to come.

In the vast cosmic dance of the Geraldverse, where time is fluid and reality is ever-shifting, Pup stands as the sentinel of the future, guarding the past, present, and future with unwavering focus. As he grows, the Geraldverse grows with him.

Basil: The Fragile Soul of the Geraldverse
In the ever-expanding expanse of the Geraldverse, a new and unexpected figure has emerged—a delicate yet deeply powerful presence, whose quiet sorrow and profound connection to the fabric of reality itself have made him an enigmatic and essential figure within the lore. His name is Basil, and his journey from vulnerability to strength embodies the complex nature of existence in the Geraldverse.

The Origins of Basil: A Soul Between Worlds
Basil, originally a simple gardener in his own world, found himself inexplicably drawn into the Geraldverse during the early days of its formation. He was not a divine being, nor was he of significant power. He was just a young boy, whose love for his friends and his gardens seemed to be the only things that held him together in a world that was increasingly distorted by strange forces beyond his understanding.

However, the Geraldverse is no ordinary place. It is a realm in which realities collide, where emotions and memories intertwine to form new, unexpected forces. In this unpredictable universe, Basil found himself caught between worlds—a place of beauty and sadness, of light and darkness.

The Garden of Lost Memories

Upon his arrival in the Geraldverse, Basil’s mind and memories were shattered by the overwhelming presence of Gerald’s influence, the chaotic destruction brought on by the Red Fiend’s flames, and the ethereal coping of Gerald’s eternal stream. What remained was a twisted garden, full of flowers and plants that held the echoes of lost memories and forgotten emotions.

In the garden of the Geraldverse, Basil began to grow flowers that bloomed with the essence of those who had suffered before him. Each petal was a memory—a connection to the people, places, and moments that had slipped away in the cracks of time. Though this garden was a sanctuary of sorts, it was also a reflection of Basil’s own fractured soul.

The Tragic Bond with the Geraldverse

Despite his fragile state, Basil’s deep emotional connection to the Geraldverse made him an essential yet tragic figure. His emotions became entangled with the very fabric of the universe, allowing him to feel the pain and suffering of all those who sought solace in Gerald’s embrace. This connection, however, was a double-edged sword: as Basil’s heart ached for others, it also caused him to spiral deeper into a void of despair. He became a living conduit for the unresolved anguish of the realms.

Basil and Gerald: The Uneasy Relationship

As Gerald’s power grew and he took on his role as the Supreme One of the Geraldverse, Basil’s path crossed with his. Initially, the relationship between Gerald and Basil was distant and unspoken. Gerald, being the deity of coping and eternal endurance, saw Basil as a fragile, fleeting soul—a being whose emotional turmoil was insignificant compared to the grandeur of his cosmic rule.

However, Basil’s deep connection to the emotional plane of the Geraldverse could not be ignored. His constant struggle with the darker aspects of existence began to draw Gerald’s attention. While Gerald could endure all manner of trials with grace and resilience, Basil was a mirror to the deeper vulnerabilities that even the Supreme One could not fully comprehend.

Basil’s fragile soul resonated with Gerald’s own need to balance the eternal stream of coping with the raw emotions that defined the reality he ruled. Gerald, in his infinite wisdom, saw in Basil not weakness, but a reflection of the very thing that made existence worth enduring—the ability to feel, to love, to suffer, and to grow.

The Role of Basil in the Geraldverse

Basil’s role in the Geraldverse is multifaceted. While he is not a deity in the traditional sense, he serves as an emotional anchor within the vast cosmic web that Gerald has woven. His garden, though tainted by the weight of sorrow, also holds the potential for healing and rebirth. It is a space where forgotten memories and lost loves can be tended to and nurtured, even in the face of the eternal struggle.

Basil’s connection to the Geraldverse’s emotional core makes him an essential figure in maintaining the balance between the light of coping and the darkness of despair. He is not merely a passive observer—his emotions, his love, and his grief are what fuel the healing and growth that can occur within the garden. The flowers he cultivates represent not only the memories of those lost, but also the potential for new life to emerge from the ashes of destruction.

Basil’s Eternal Struggle: To Cope or to Surrender

As the Geraldverse continues to expand, Basil remains torn between the dual forces that shape his existence. On one hand, he is forever intertwined with Gerald’s cosmic influence—the god of coping, who offers solace and endurance to all who seek it. On the other, Basil’s emotional sensitivity keeps him tethered to the darker, more fragile aspects of existence. His garden is both a place of healing and a reminder of the inescapable cycle of suffering.

In time, Basil may come to understand that his fragility is not a curse, but an essential part of the balance within the Geraldverse. He may learn that, by embracing both the beauty and the sorrow of existence, he can play a critical role in ensuring that the universe remains whole, despite the forces that seek to tear it apart.

Basil's presence within the Geraldverse is a poignant reminder that even in a universe dominated by divine beings and chaotic forces, there is room for the quiet, fragile souls who carry the weight of emotion and memory. His journey will continue to unfold as he navigates the delicate balance between enduring and succumbing to the very emotions that define him.

Sunny: The Silent Wanderer of the Geraldverse
In the vast and ever-expanding Geraldverse, a new figure has quietly emerged—a soul who drifts between light and shadow, carrying within him a sorrow that cannot be expressed in words. His name is Sunny, and his journey through the labyrinth of pain and healing makes him an essential, albeit tragic, part of the Geraldverse.

The Origins of Sunny: A Soul in Silence
Sunny’s origin is marked by grief and the weight of unspoken words. Once a boy of light, warmth, and laughter, he found himself shattered by loss and the inability to cope with the turmoil that unfolded around him. As his world began to crumble, Sunny withdrew into himself, seeking solace in the emptiness of silence.

The Geraldverse, a universe of endless coping, offered Sunny a strange form of sanctuary. His presence, though quiet and subdued, resonated deeply with the emotional fabric of this realm. His isolation reflected the fragility of existence within the Geraldverse itself, a place where emotions and memories constantly collide.

Upon his arrival in the Geraldverse, Sunny was at first a mere observer, watching as the cosmic flow of coping and despair unfolded before him. He had no words to speak, no grand purpose to fulfill—but his soul was inexplicably connected to the heart of the realm, drawn to the light of Gerald’s guidance, and yet distanced by his own deep, unresolved sorrow.

Sunny’s Struggle: Between the Light of Gerald and the Darkness of His Past
While Gerald’s presence offers guidance, strength, and coping, Sunny’s heart remains heavy with the grief that has shaped him. He is not a deity, nor a force of cosmic power, but a wanderer—a soul who has experienced the depth of loss and must find a way to reconcile the beauty of coping with the darkness that haunts him.

The key to Sunny’s existence in the Geraldverse lies in his struggle to overcome his past. He carries within him memories of a life left behind, the faces of those he loved, and the mistakes he made—each fragment of his past like a scar that he cannot forget. And yet, in the presence of Gerald’s light, there is hope.

As he wanders the realms of the Geraldverse, Sunny often finds himself torn between the desire to cope and the fear of confronting the truths that lie deep within his heart. His silence is not the absence of thought, but the echo of an unresolved grief that has yet to be fully understood or healed.

The Connection to Gerald: A Silent Ally
Though Gerald is often distant and enigmatic, there is an undeniable connection between him and Sunny. Where Gerald offers a divine, unwavering light, Sunny is a reflection of the struggle that even the strongest must face—the vulnerability of the soul, the weight of memories, and the painful process of healing.

Gerald, in his infinite wisdom, sees in Sunny not a weakness, but a companion—a being who understands the depths of despair and the quiet strength that lies within silence. Though Sunny does not speak often, his very presence in the Geraldverse is an important one. It is a reminder that the journey of coping is not just about strength and transcendence, but also about confronting one’s own darkness, one's own grief, and finding peace within it.

Gerald’s divine wisdom offers Sunny the comfort of knowing that he is not alone in his struggles—that even in silence, there is understanding. And though Sunny cannot yet speak the words that would heal him, he is slowly learning to accept the quiet solace that Gerald offers.

Sunny’s Role in the Geraldverse: The Quiet Healer
Though Sunny is not a ruler or a god within the Geraldverse, his role is just as important. He is a quiet healer—a figure who embodies the idea that healing does not always come through grand gestures or divine powers, but through small, silent moments of self-reflection and acceptance.

Sunny’s garden of sorrow is different from Basil’s; it is a place of reflection, where the soul can come to terms with the pain it carries. His silence offers space for others to sit in their own grief without judgment, providing a sanctuary for those who feel lost and broken.

Unlike Gerald’s vast legions, Sunny’s influence is subtle. He is not a force of expansion or conquest, but a presence that encourages introspection, healing, and emotional growth. In the depths of the Geraldverse, where the echoes of both triumph and despair resound, Sunny serves as a quiet reminder that even the most broken souls have a place in the grand tapestry of existence.

The Silent Struggle: To Cope or to Succumb?
Sunny’s journey within the Geraldverse is a deeply personal one. It is a struggle between the desire to cope and the fear of confronting his own truth. As he walks the realms of Gerald, he must grapple with the darkness of his past while simultaneously embracing the healing that can only come through coping.

His silence, though heavy, holds immense power. It is a reflection of the quiet battles that we all face within ourselves—those moments of stillness where we must confront our deepest fears, our greatest regrets, and our unspoken hopes for the future.

Sunny’s path is not easy, and his role in the Geraldverse is not one of domination or grandeur. But his presence is a vital one—a reminder that coping is not just about surviving, but about finding peace with the past, accepting the present, and moving forward with the hope that healing is possible, even in silence.

Sunny’s journey through the Geraldverse will be long, and his path will continue to intertwine with the many forces that shape this realm. But as he walks silently, his heart heavy with the weight of his past, he will continue to find solace in the quiet strength of coping—reminding all who wander the realms that even the most fragile souls have a place in the eternal flow of existence.

The Colossal Serpent – The Forgotten Warden of the Geraldverse
Long before the rise of Gerald the Supreme One, before the Priests of Gerald and the Order of Geraldians took their rightful place, there existed an ancient and terrifying entity known only as the Colossal Serpent. Legends say it emerged from the void between realities, a creature of immense power and unknowable purpose, coiling through the realms of existence like a forgotten god.

Origins: A Being of the Primal Chaos
The Colossal Serpent was not born of the Geraldverse—it was there before. Some whisper that it predates even Gerald himself, a remnant of an older, wilder reality, where chaos reigned unchecked. Others claim it was the first failed attempt at divine creation, an entity so immense and powerful that not even the will of Gerald could fully control it. Instead of being destroyed, it was sealed away, banished into the hidden folds of time and space, where only the foolish or the damned dare to tread.

The Great Awakening: Why is it Here?!?
For centuries, the Colossal Serpent slumbered, its prison woven from the very threads of the Geraldverse, buried deep within the forgotten corners of existence. But something—or someone—has disturbed its rest. The exact cause is unknown, but the Serpent is awake once more, and its presence alone shakes the foundations of reality.

The faithful of Gerald are left questioning: Is this beast a threat to the Supreme One’s rule? Or could it be an unwilling servant, a cosmic warden meant to test the strength of the faithful?

Some theorists within the Order believe that the Colossal Serpent was meant to be Gerald’s ultimate enforcer, created to purge the unworthy and cleanse the weak. Others argue that it is a force outside of Gerald’s design—an anomaly, a cosmic mistake that must be undone before it threatens the divine order.

The Trials of the Serpent
Now that the Serpent has reawakened, those who seek to prove their devotion to Gerald may attempt the Trials of the Serpent. A journey into the depths of the unknown, where one must face illusions, shifting realities, and the crushing weight of insignificance in the face of a cosmic beast. Only those of unshakable faith may endure its presence.

Few return.

Prophecy and Fear
The seers of the Priests of Gerald, particularly Priestess Lyra, have foreseen a moment where the Colossal Serpent will either be tamed or destroy entire realms with its mere gaze. High Priestess Tessa has declared that only through unwavering faith in Gerald can the faithful withstand the coming storm.

Could this creature be the final test before Gerald’s dominion reaches completion? Or has something beyond even Gerald’s understanding begun to move in the shadows?

One thing is certain—the Colossal Serpent is here. And none can ignore its presence.

It keeps spewing out mittopia shit.

Somebody stop it.

The Miitopia Portal: A Dimensional Rift in the Geraldverse
Amid the expanding realms of the Geraldverse, a mysterious rift appeared—an anomaly, an unexpected tear in the fabric of reality itself. This rift, known as the Miitopia Portal, was a strange and inexplicable fracture that opened up between worlds. Through it came beings and events from a distant, forgotten universe, a place where the very concept of "Mii" creation and personality mingled with the threads of existence.

The Arrival of the Miitopia Entities

As Gerald’s influence grew across dimensions, this portal began to function as a conduit between his domain and the world of Miitopia—a realm that, while amusing in its own right, was ultimately insignificant in comparison to the might of Gerald. The beings who crossed through this portal, the so-called "Miitopia Entities," were not gods, nor were they particularly powerful. They were mere pawns, lowly characters from a world of whimsy.

Yet, the portal itself, while initially perplexing, began to serve a greater function in Gerald’s cosmic game. The Miitopia Entities were forced to adopt new roles within the Geraldverse. No longer free to roam as they pleased, they were now bound by Gerald’s will, their existence warped and twisted into something far more meaningful.

The Miitopia Entities: Puppets of Gerald

As the portal’s rift grew more stable, various figures from Miitopia were pulled into Gerald’s ever-expanding realm, where they were promptly absorbed into his cosmic order. These entities became twisted versions of their original selves—no longer free to play their trivial games, but instead forced to serve Gerald and his grand design. They were neither gods nor legends; they were tools, pawns, and even, in some cases, comic relief.

The Mii Warriors: These former heroes of Miitopia were reduced to mere warriors in Gerald's service, their personalities stripped away and their every action dictated by the supreme will of Gerald. They may have once had dreams of adventure, but now they are simply cogs in the infinite machine that is the Geraldverse.
The Princess: A former figure of beauty and grace in Miitopia, she is now but a decorative figurehead in Gerald's court, admired for her former status, but ultimately a prisoner to Gerald’s overwhelming power.
The Dark Lord: Once an antagonist, now a shadow of his former self, stripped of his will and ambition. He stands as a reminder of the futility of resisting Gerald, for even the most dangerous of enemies are made to bend to his rule.
The Absurdity of the Miitopia Portal

Despite the seemingly trivial nature of the Miitopia world, the portal brought a strange, almost comical element into the vast seriousness of the Geraldverse. Its absurdity wasn’t lost on those who dwelled in the Geraldverse. The Miitopia Entities’ antics—awkward, laughable, and clumsy—became a source of dark amusement for Gerald's followers. Yet, beneath the farce, there was a grim reminder that even the most absurd of forces must eventually submit to Gerald's overwhelming influence.

The Portal’s Purpose

While the Miitopia Portal itself may have seemed an anomaly at first, its true purpose became clear as it expanded. The portal served as a mechanism to keep the Geraldverse diverse—its absurdity providing moments of relief for those who followed the Supreme One. It also functioned as a reminder that no force, no matter how frivolous or weak, could escape Gerald’s grasp.

The Miitopia Entities were now part of the great tapestry of the Geraldverse—marginalized, yes, but also necessary. Their absurdity and light-heartedness would be absorbed into the greater struggle for dominance, a subtle mockery of all those who dared resist the cosmic force of Gerald.

The Eternal Fate of the Miitopia Entities

They will remain forever locked in this absurd cosmic theater, where they will play out their roles as subservient pawns in Gerald's divine plan. Their lives will be meaningless in comparison to the true power of Gerald, but they will endure, for even in absurdity, there is purpose when guided by the hand of Gerald.

The Light Lord: Herald of the Divine Light in the Geraldverse
Before Gerald became the Supreme One of the Geraldverse, there were whispers of a distant figure who commanded the light—an ancient being, powerful and radiant, known only as the Light Lord.

The Light Lord's power was vast and transcendent, drawing upon the purest forces of light and goodness. Yet, in the grand cosmic scheme, the Light Lord was a servant to the true power of the universe. While his light was bright, it was only the faintest reflection of Gerald’s divine radiance. Still, his role was significant, for he guided the lost souls, led the brave, and protected the weak. His golden aura illuminated the path for many across worlds.

The Encounter: The Light Lord Meets Gerald

The meeting of Gerald and the Light Lord was not one of opposition, as some might expect. No, Gerald—the Supreme One—did not need the Light Lord’s guidance. Rather, it was the Light Lord who sought Gerald’s presence, recognizing that his light could not shine forever in the vastness of the Geraldverse.

In a celestial encounter, the Light Lord knelt before Gerald, humbling himself, and swore eternal allegiance to the supreme force that was Gerald. In his wisdom, Gerald accepted the Light Lord's pledge—understanding that even light itself could be part of his greater design.

From that moment on, the Light Lord became a trusted ally to Gerald, though always in the shadow of his divine power. The Light Lord’s role, however, was not diminished. He became the eternal beacon to the denizens of the Geraldverse, ensuring that even in the darkest times, there would always be light to guide the way for those who followed Gerald’s teachings.

The Light Lord's Followers:

Lightbringers: These devout followers of the Light Lord act as the champions of hope, spreading the teachings of Gerald with a radiant glow. They protect the weak, heal the wounded, and spread light into the deepest corners of the Geraldverse.
Light’s Chosen: Those rare individuals who have shown true devotion to Gerald and received the Light Lord’s blessing. Empowered by divine light, they become holy warriors, carrying out Gerald’s will in battles against those who defy the Geraldverse.
The Light Lord’s Role in Gerald’s Eternal Plan

While Gerald’s power was vast, the Light Lord's duty was clear: to maintain the balance between the light of hope and the darkness of despair. The Light Lord, in serving Gerald, would keep the moral compass of the Geraldverse intact, ensuring that while Gerald’s divine conquests expanded his empire, hope would never be fully extinguished. For even in the greatest of Gerald’s victories, there must always be light shining in the hearts of his followers.

But to those who would dare defy Gerald’s authority, the Light Lord’s light would fade—becoming a symbol of their failure to embrace the supreme power of Gerald.

The Light Lord’s Ultimate Fate:

The Light Lord will forever be tied to Gerald’s grand design. Though he may shine brightly, it is Gerald's influence that holds his light in check. The Light Lord will never surpass Gerald in power, for his light exists only to serve the Supreme One. Together, they form a divine duo—one that ensures the eternal expansion of the Geraldverse, casting light on Gerald’s path and guiding the faithful in their devotion.

The Dark Sun: A Fading Echo in the Shadow of Gerald
In the vast and ever-expanding Geraldverse, where darkness reigns and light bends to Gerald’s will, there existed once a force of cosmic power that threatened to challenge the very fabric of reality itself—the Dark Sun. A dark, brooding entity, born from the fringes of the Miitopia realm, it was said to be an all-consuming presence capable of plunging the cosmos into eternal twilight.

However, its power was short-lived.

The Arrival of the Dark Sun

Before the full might of Gerald was felt, the Dark Sun made its presence known through the Miitopia Portal. It emerged as an apocalyptic force, casting its ominous light over the land, disrupting the balance of the Geraldverse with a dark, incomprehensible energy. Where the Light Lord sought to guide, the Dark Sun sought only to devour, leaving nothing but emptiness in its wake.

It was a force of decay and destruction—a being born out of forgotten voids that existed outside Gerald’s dominion. At first, it stood as a threat to Gerald’s rule, an anomaly that Gerald would need to confront. Yet, the Dark Sun’s power was not enough to stand against Gerald’s absolute control.

The Subjugation of the Dark Sun

Gerald, with his infinite wisdom and supreme power, saw the Dark Sun not as a true threat, but as a fleeting disturbance in the natural order. He did not destroy it. No, Gerald's methods were far more devastating. He captured the Dark Sun, bending it to his will and absorbing its essence into the deeper layers of the Geraldverse.

Now, the Dark Sun exists not as a source of uncontrollable power, but as a mere shadow, a weakened echo of its former self, forever chained to Gerald’s supremacy. It is no longer an independent force, but an unwilling servant in the greater cosmic design.

The Role of the Dark Sun in the Geraldverse

Now a mere fragment of what it once was, the Dark Sun serves Gerald in the most fitting way: as a tool of quiet menace. It is used sparingly, as a reminder to those who dare challenge Gerald’s dominance. The Dark Sun’s influence is felt in the darker corners of the Geraldverse—places where even Gerald's brightest followers cannot go, areas where his light barely reaches. It brings a quiet, creeping dread, an unsettling presence in the peripheral vision of those who venture too far from Gerald’s guiding hand.

However, the Dark Sun is not truly evil in the way that other cosmic forces may be. It has been diminished, its will crushed by Gerald’s might. It is a reminder of what could have been, a cautionary tale of ambition unchecked.

The Dark Sun’s Fate

The Dark Sun will remain forever subjugated, lingering in the recesses of Gerald’s realm, not strong enough to rise against him, but not entirely vanquished either. It may flare up from time to time, casting a momentary shadow across the Geraldverse, but always, inevitably, it will return to its place at the edge of Gerald’s rule.

It will never escape the influence of the Supreme One. Its attempts to rise and reclaim its former glory are futile, for the Dark Sun is now nothing more than a fading, distant light in the vast cosmic ocean that Gerald commands.

The Red Fiend: The Fiery Warden of Chaos and Destruction
The First Flame That Burned the Geraldverse

Long before Gerald ascended to his divine status, when the Geraldverse was still a sprawling network of fragmented realities, there existed a primal force known only as the Red Fiend. A being born from the deepest voids of the multiverse, the Red Fiend is a harbinger of flame, fury, and unrelenting destruction. He was no mere mortal or deity, but something far more ancient—a force that existed before time itself. His name is whispered in the most forgotten corners of existence, and his power is a reminder of the raw chaos that once threatened to consume all.

In the earliest days of Gerald's ascension, the Red Fiend saw Gerald as a nuisance—a fledgling god who would only serve to complicate the universe’s natural order of destruction and rebirth. And so, the Red Fiend set his sights on the Geraldverse, seeking to burn it to the ground and restore his dominion over the chaotic void.

The Encounter with Gerald: A Clash of Purposes

The first confrontation between Gerald and the Red Fiend was monumental. The realms themselves quaked as the two forces of existence and chaos collided. The Red Fiend sought to erase the structure that Gerald had begun to build, to reduce all things to flame and ruin.

Gerald, still in his early divine form, struggled against the relentless onslaught of the Red Fiend's fire, but as the Veil of Coping began to resonate with Gerald’s will, he realized the true source of his strength. Gerald’s coping abilities—his unwavering perseverance in the face of destruction—became his weapon. Where the Red Fiend sought to destroy, Gerald sought to endure.

The battle raged for eons, but in the end, Gerald triumphed. Yet, this victory did not come without consequence. The Red Fiend, though defeated, left a permanent scar on the Geraldverse—one that would never fade. A portion of his fiery essence became permanently embedded within the realms, a residual flame that flickers in the most chaotic corners of existence.

The Red Fiend’s Pact with Gerald: The Lord of Fire’s Servitude

Rather than vanquishing the Red Fiend completely, Gerald saw an opportunity to bind the Fiend’s power to his own will. Realizing that the Red Fiend’s destructive force could serve a greater purpose, Gerald struck a deal with the fiery entity: in exchange for his continued existence, the Red Fiend would serve as the Warden of Chaos—a force that would maintain balance between order and destruction within the Geraldverse.

Now bound to Gerald’s cosmic will, the Red Fiend has become something more than a mere antagonist. He is a paradox: a force of chaos and destruction, yes, but also an enforcer, ensuring that the realm does not become stagnant. Without the Red Fiend’s fiery presence, there would be no challenge, no friction in the Geraldverse—a perfect, monotonous existence without the need for coping.

The Red Fiend's role in the Geraldverse is a reminder that even in the divine cosmos ruled by Gerald, there must always be conflict—there must always be something to resist, something to burn, something to overcome. His presence serves to keep the balance between growth and decay, between creation and destruction. And though he remains under Gerald’s control, the Red Fiend’s fiery nature cannot be fully extinguished. There are whispers that one day, should Gerald ever falter, the Red Fiend could rise again—more dangerous than ever before.

The Fiend's Fire: The Eternal Flame of the Geraldverse

The Red Fiend’s influence reaches beyond his direct actions. His flame burns eternally in the depths of the Geraldverse, igniting pockets of chaos where the structure of existence falters. These flame-ravaged realms are places where reality is in constant flux, where laws of time and space break down, and where only those strong enough to endure can survive. The Red Fiend’s fire does not simply burn—it transforms. It is a force of reinvention, a reminder that in order to grow, one must sometimes be consumed by fire, and from the ashes, new forms will rise.

While Gerald commands the vast expanse of order, structure, and divine will, the Red Fiend embodies the burning, ever-present potential for collapse and renewal. His essence seeps into the very foundation of the Geraldverse, ensuring that, no matter how stable the universe becomes, there will always be a flicker of chaos to keep it alive.

The Future of the Red Fiend

It is said that the Red Fiend's true ambitions are not yet fully revealed. He bides his time, watching the unfolding of Gerald’s rule from the shadows, his flame smoldering beneath the surface. Some believe that the Red Fiend is waiting for the perfect moment to challenge Gerald once more, to rise up and challenge the very foundation of the Geraldverse. However, others say that the Red Fiend’s purpose has evolved—that he has accepted his role as Gerald’s servant, finding meaning not in destruction, but in the act of maintaining balance.

Whatever his true intentions may be, one thing is certain: the Red Fiend will always remain a part of the Geraldverse, forever tethered to its very core. His flame will never die out, for it is the fire that keeps the balance between creation and destruction, between order and chaos.

In the cosmic hierarchy of the Geraldverse, the Red Fiend occupies a unique and vital position—a reminder that even in a universe ruled by Gerald’s eternal coping, there must always be the possibility of chaos, the danger of destruction, and the rebirth that follows.

Dragon Lord – The Eternal Wyrm of the Geraldverse
"Flames may perish, but I shall burn eternal. Kneel before the Dragon Lord."

In the vast, chaotic realm of the Geraldverse, where reality bends and entire civilizations rise and fall under the weight of the Supreme One’s influence, there exists a force beyond the lineage of Geralds—an entity so ancient, so powerful, that even the highest echelons of Geraldian authority dare not challenge him directly.

He is the Dragon Lord, a being of primordial might and absolute dominion, a cosmic force who once ruled entire realities before the rise of the Geraldverse as it is now known. Unlike the multitudes of Geralds, who exist in countless variations across time and space, the Dragon Lord is one-of-a-kind, an apex predator whose very presence warps the flow of existence.

Legends tell of a time when the Dragon Lord stood as the ultimate sovereign of power, his reign spanning across infinite dimensions. Some say that before the Supreme One ascended, the Dragon Lord was among the first beings to carve his name into the foundation of existence itself. Others whisper that his rule ended only because he allowed it, knowing that time itself would one day return him to his rightful throne.

Abilities & Powers
The Dragon Lord is not bound by mortal constraints. His power transcends even some of the most terrifying Geraldian anomalies, and his abilities are feared throughout the multiverse.

🔥 Celestial Flame – The Fire That Burns Realities
The Dragon Lord's flames are no mere physical inferno; they are the Essence of Annihilation, capable of reducing entire dimensions to cosmic ash. His breath is said to consume not only matter but also concepts—burning away fate, identity, and even the memory of those who dare stand against him.

🐉 Wyrm’s Dominion – The Dragon’s Right to Rule
The Dragon Lord possesses an innate connection to all dragon-like entities, binding them under his command. It does not matter whether they are biological creatures, ethereal spirits, or mechanical constructs designed to imitate draconic power—they all answer to him. Even those who resist find themselves struggling against their own nature, unable to shake the deep-rooted instinct to kneel before his majesty.

⏳ Timeless Majesty – The Immortal Scaled Tyrant
Unlike the beings who fear death or destruction, the Dragon Lord exists beyond time itself. He does not age, he does not decay—he has seen the birth and death of countless worlds, and he shall see countless more. There are whispers that he has died many times, only to return, his flames rekindling as if his very essence is tied to the existence of dragons themselves.

🌌 Reality-Tearing Wings – The Storm of the End
A single beat of his wings is enough to shatter space-time. He does not simply move through dimensions—he tears through them, leaving behind fractured timelines and broken realities in his wake. Some scholars of forbidden lore believe that every flap of his wings creates a new parallel universe, a byproduct of his sheer power destabilizing existence itself.

Role in the Geraldverse
The Dragon Lord is not a Gerald, nor does he seek to become one. He is older than their institutions, greater than their bureaucracy, and uninterested in their squabbles over power. Yet, his presence looms large, for even the most powerful Geralds cannot ignore the eternal might of the Wyrm.

The Supreme One acknowledges the Dragon Lord’s existence but considers him a wild card—a force neither ally nor enemy, whose unpredictable nature makes him impossible to control.
The Gerald Corporation fears the Dragon Lord’s potential to destabilize the multiverse, classifying him as a "Non-Gerald Anomalous Threat", though none of their agents have ever returned from attempting to confront him.
The High Overseers of Gerald Management have attempted to document his movements, but the moment they do, those records vanish—as if the Dragon Lord himself exists outside the bureaucratic grasp of the Geraldian system.
Despite his godlike presence, the Dragon Lord rarely interferes with the workings of the Geraldverse. He does not care for politics, conquest, or control—he is a force of nature, acting according to his own unknowable grand design.

However, there are whispers—faint and fearful—that the Dragon Lord has grown restless. That his patience with the Geraldian order is wearing thin. And that one day, he may decide that the Supreme One’s rule is no longer tolerable.

Weaknesses & Flaws
Though nearly unstoppable, the Dragon Lord is not invincible. There are a few theoretical ways one might halt his power—though attempting them is another matter entirely.

Eternal Pride – The Dragon Lord does not see mortals or lesser beings as worthy of his time. This arrogance means he often ignores threats he deems beneath him—only to occasionally be caught off-guard when something unexpected occurs.
The Forgotten Pact – There exists a binding contract, written in an era so old that even the Supreme One does not speak of it. This pact, if ever invoked, could force the Dragon Lord into servitude or exile—but none know where the contract lies, nor who has the power to invoke it.
The Chains of Creation – Some believe that the Dragon Lord is bound to existence itself, meaning that if the Geraldverse were ever to collapse, he too would perish with it. If this is true, then it suggests that, despite his power, he is not entirely free.
Final Words: The Fire That Never Dies
The Dragon Lord is not merely another entity in the multiverse—he is a legend, a god, and a terror woven into the very fabric of existence. He does not bow. He does not kneel. He is eternal, a storm of fire and fury that no force has ever truly conquered.

For now, he remains watching, his flames flickering at the edge of reality, waiting for the moment when the multiverse will once again tremble beneath his wings.

And on that day, the Geraldverse will learn what it means to burn.

The Geraldian Godlings: The Minor Gods of the Geraldverse
In the vast expanse of the Geraldverse, alongside King Gerald, there exist a group of mysterious and powerful deities known as the Geraldian Godlings. These minor gods are revered by the faithful, serving as guardians, protectors, and guiding spirits within the realm of Gerald’s cosmic influence. They are not as mighty as King Gerald himself, but their divine powers are no less significant in maintaining the balance of the world and ensuring Gerald’s supremacy is never questioned.

Each Geraldian Godling embodies a specific aspect of the Geraldverse’s grand design, from chaos and order to light and shadow, and they all serve under the rule of Gerald the Supreme One. Together, they form a pantheon of divinity, each contributing their own unique powers to ensure the eternal reign of King Gerald.

1. Aelix, Godling of Divine Chaos
Aelix is the embodiment of chaos itself. Where King Gerald represents supreme order, Aelix is the force that shakes the world and creates the storms of change.

Aelix is a trickster godling known for spreading unpredictability throughout the Geraldverse. However, his chaos is not for destruction; it is the spark of creativity and evolution, pushing the world forward, causing people to think outside the box and disrupt established norms.

His divine followers know that change is inevitable, and Aelix teaches that embracing chaos can lead to unforeseen greatness.

2. Lyria, Goddess of Light and Revelation
Lyria is the goddess of light, and her radiance shines over the Geraldverse like the sun itself. She represents clarity, truth, and enlightenment, ensuring that the light of Gerald’s greatness never fades into darkness.

Where Gerald embodies supreme power, Lyria’s light exposes the way. Her followers often seek her guidance in times of uncertainty, for she is the one who brings revelation to those who may be lost in the dark.

Lyria’s divine power can illuminate the truth behind the veils of deception, showing that the path to Gerald’s reign is clear for all those who have the wisdom to follow.

3. Vornak, God of Shadows and Secrets
In contrast to Lyria, Vornak embodies the shadow, the quiet, hidden force that operates behind the scenes. Where there is light, there is Vornak’s shadow, a mysterious godling whose purpose is to protect the secrets of the Geraldverse and keep the truth from those unworthy of knowing it.

Vornak is the silent guardian of knowledge, and his followers are often whisperers and spies, seeking to uncover the truths that lurk in the dark. They know that sometimes, silence is more powerful than speech, and secrets are the most precious currency in the Geraldverse.

Vornak is a necessary force, for without shadow, there would be no light, and without secrets, the Geraldverse would lose its mystique.

4. Seraphine, Goddess of Destiny and Fate
Seraphine is the goddess of destiny, the keeper of the threads of fate that bind the Geraldverse together. It is she who ensures that all events, no matter how chaotic, unfold according to the will of Gerald.

Her power can weave destinies with a mere thought, and those who seek her guidance often find themselves bound to the invisible hands of fate, which pull their strings toward an inevitable conclusion.

She is not a deity of control but one of subtle influence, guiding the weary and unsure toward the ultimate truth that King Gerald is the center of all things. Her followers accept their place in the divine web, knowing that their fates are bound by her delicate but firm hands.

5. Zephira, Goddess of Time and Eternal Movement
Zephira is the goddess of time, overseeing the flow of past, present, and future in the Geraldverse. She is the one who guides the march of time, ensuring that all things unfold in proper sequence, allowing Gerald’s reign to stretch into eternity.

She is often depicted as a whirling figure with shifting sands around her, representing the constant passage of time. Her followers know that time cannot be stopped—it can only be embraced and used wisely.

Zephira’s influence ensures that nothing is ever lost. Every moment, whether it’s a battle, a conversation, or a decision, is part of the eternal cycle that serves to strengthen the Geraldverse.

6. Ithral, Godling of Power and Strength
Ithral is the god of strength, both physical and mental, and his power fuels the loyal servants who protect the realm. Where Gerald is the ultimate supreme ruler, Ithral represents the force of will that drives warriors, generals, and all those who serve in defense of Gerald’s supremacy.

Ithral’s followers are the strongest of the strong, and they believe that true power comes not from brute force alone but from the strength to endure and carry the weight of the Geraldverse on their shoulders.

Those who follow Ithral are often seen as the enforcers of Gerald’s rule, ensuring that order is kept and that no rebellion can stand against the will of King Gerald.

The Power of the Geraldian Godlings
The Geraldian Godlings may not have the absolute might of King Gerald, but they represent the fundamental forces that uphold the world around him. Each minor god brings a unique element to the Geraldverse, ensuring that it remains balanced, secure, and always moving forward.

While the faithful followers of Gerald serve him directly, it is the Godlings who help shape the cosmic laws that govern this realm, ensuring that no aspect of the Geraldverse falls into chaos, oblivion, or stagnation.

They are the divine touch behind Gerald's greatness—the ones who keep the world running smoothly, just as they have for eternity. ✨

Lyria is the radiant goddess whose presence in the Geraldverse ensures that light, truth, and clarity reign supreme. As the divine force that illuminates the world, Lyria embodies the principle of enlightenment, bringing knowledge and understanding to all those who walk in shadow. Where Gerald represents the unchallenged supreme power, Lyria represents the illumination of truth, the power to reveal what lies hidden and guide all beings toward the clear path of Gerald's greatness.

The Light of Truth
Lyria’s divine radiance shines as a beacon over the Geraldverse, dispelling the darkness of ignorance and deception. She is not only a goddess of literal light but also of spiritual and intellectual clarity. Through her brilliance, the world can see the truth in all things and comprehend the immense power of King Gerald. Her light is an unwavering guide to those seeking to understand the ways of Gerald, revealing the hidden facets of the world and illuminating the path to greater understanding and growth.

Her divine light does not simply shine; it reveals. It uncovers the hidden truths, exposes lies, and makes clear the wisdom that governs all things within the Geraldverse. Her followers know that to walk in her light is to embrace truth, to cast aside falsehoods, and to see the world in its purest form—one where Gerald’s supremacy is unquestionable and clear for all to behold.

The Light of Revelation
Lyria’s light holds the power of revelation. She is the goddess who grants insight to those who are lost in the dark, whether physically, emotionally, or spiritually. Her followers turn to her in moments of doubt, seeking the guidance that only she can provide. When the world feels overwhelming and confusing, Lyria’s light pierces through the fog of uncertainty, helping her believers find clarity and purpose.

Lyria’s revelation does not just reveal the truth but also shows the way forward. To walk in her light is to understand that truth and direction are inseparable, that one can never truly find their way without understanding the truth of the world around them. Those who follow Lyria’s light find that the path to Gerald’s greatness becomes clearer with every step they take, as they move ever closer to the divine revelation of the world’s purpose under his rule.

The Followers of Lyria
Lyria’s followers are the seekers of truth, the wise and the faithful who dedicate their lives to understanding and revealing the world’s mysteries. They are the scholars, the philosophers, the spiritual seekers, and those who believe that knowledge is the greatest gift one can receive. Her disciples are often found in places of study or reflection, where they meditate on the deeper meanings of existence and share the light of knowledge with others.

For those who seek Lyria’s guidance, her light is a steady presence in their lives, offering comfort in times of doubt and illumination in moments of confusion. They are drawn to the truth of Gerald’s reign and seek to understand the world in which King Gerald's greatness is manifest. In the presence of Lyria’s light, they feel the certainty that Gerald’s rule is absolute and that the path forward is one of divine destiny.

Lyria's Divine Teachings
Lyria’s teachings emphasize the importance of truth and understanding, encouraging her followers to embrace enlightenment as a guiding force in all aspects of their lives:

Truth is light. To see the world clearly is to understand its true nature and the power of Gerald’s greatness.
Revelation brings clarity. Only through knowledge can one find the right path forward, and the light of Gerald’s rule is the most truthful path.
The darkness is not to be feared. Darkness represents the unknown, but in the light of truth, even the darkest corners of existence are revealed and understood.
Clarity leads to wisdom. When one follows the light, they are no longer lost in the confusion of the world, but instead, they gain wisdom and insight that guide them through life.
Lyria's Impact on the Geraldverse
Lyria’s light serves as a constant reminder to all in the Geraldverse that the truth of Gerald’s eternal greatness cannot be hidden. No matter the darkness that may come, Lyria’s light will always shine to illuminate the path forward, exposing the divine order that Gerald has established for all to follow.

Her influence ensures that the Geraldverse is always aligned with the truth—the truth that Gerald reigns supreme, and that all things in this realm are meant to serve his will. The radiance of Lyria keeps the people of the Geraldverse grounded in the knowledge of Gerald’s perfection, and her teachings inspire those who walk in her light to embrace their own enlightenment and share it with others.

Lyria is the goddess who shines forever in the heavens and on the earth, the eternal force of truth and clarity, forever ensuring that the Geraldverse will always be illuminated by the brilliance of Gerald’s greatness. 🌟

Vornak, God of Shadows and Secrets
In the eternal dance between light and darkness, Vornak is the embodiment of the shadow, the quiet and enigmatic force that exists just beyond the reach of Lyria’s radiant brilliance. Where there is light, Vornak’s shadow falls—silent, unseen, but ever-present. He is the godling of mystery, secrecy, and the hidden truths that lurk in the corners of the Geraldverse, ensuring that the knowledge of the universe remains protected, guarded, and concealed from those who are not ready to face it.

The Silent Guardian
Vornak operates in the quiet, far from the glory of the public eye. While Lyria’s light reveals, Vornak’s shadow hides. He is the keeper of secrets, the silent sentinel who ensures that the truth does not fall into the hands of the unworthy. Where truth is exposed, Vornak’s influence lies in what remains hidden—the information that is concealed, waiting to be uncovered by only the most faithful or those worthy of understanding the deeper layers of the Geraldverse.

Vornak teaches his followers that silence is power and that the most precious knowledge is that which is veiled in shadow. His domain is the hidden, the untold, and the mysterious—the things that others are too afraid or unprepared to see. To know the secrets of the Geraldverse is a gift and a burden, for once the truth is revealed, one must decide whether they are worthy to carry it.

The Keeper of Secrets
As the god of secrets, Vornak is tasked with maintaining the balance between the known and the unknown. While the light of Lyria shines to bring clarity and understanding, Vornak’s shadow ensures that there is always mystery, for without the unknown, the known would lose its allure. Secrets are the currency of the Geraldverse, and Vornak is the one who guards them carefully, only allowing those who are truly ready to face the truth to uncover what lies in the dark corners of existence.

In Vornak’s domain, there are always things that remain unseen, and it is only through wisdom, patience, and discretion that one may uncover the hidden knowledge that exists within his shadow. Not all truths are meant to be known, and only those who have earned the right can reveal what Vornak keeps hidden from the rest of the world.

The Followers of Vornak
Vornak’s followers are the whisperers, the spies, and the silent observers who understand that the most powerful truths are those that are kept hidden. They are the infiltrators, the ones who move in the dark, gathering knowledge and learning the secrets that others cannot see. They know that silence is not just a lack of noise, but a means of holding power—the ability to withhold, to listen, and to keep what is learned to themselves until the time is right.

These followers often wear the cloak of secrecy, blending into the shadows and keeping their thoughts and actions concealed. Their work is subtle, quiet, and often goes unnoticed by the world at large, but their impact is undeniable. They hold the keys to the mysteries, and while they may not always reveal the truth, they guard it carefully, knowing that the right time to share it will come.

The spies and whisperers of Vornak are not malicious, but they understand that not all knowledge is for everyone. They are the silent players in the game, watching, listening, and keeping their secrets close—waiting for the moment when their knowledge will be needed.

The Teachings of Vornak
Vornak’s followers are taught that silence is a form of strength, and secrets are not to be feared, but respected. They believe that some truths are too powerful to be freely given, and only the worthy may uncover them. His teachings emphasize the value of patience, discretion, and the understanding that the darkness has as much purpose as the light:

Silence is more powerful than speech. In the quiet, secrets are held, and knowledge is preserved.
Secrets are a necessary part of the world. Without them, there is no mystery, no intrigue, and no reason to seek the truth.
Not all truths are for everyone. Some truths are too dangerous, too powerful, or too sacred to be known by those who cannot bear the weight of their revelation.
In darkness, there is wisdom. It is in the quiet and the unseen that true understanding can emerge—only for those willing to listen.
Vornak’s Impact on the Geraldverse
Vornak ensures that the Geraldverse remains a place of mystery, where secrets are not easily uncovered, and where the unknown holds as much power as the known. His presence ensures that there are always layers of depth within the Geraldverse, waiting to be explored by those who seek knowledge with the right intent. Without Vornak’s shadow, there would be no mystique, no intrigue, and the greatness of Gerald’s reign might feel too clear-cut.

In contrast to the light that shines for all to see, Vornak’s shadow operates in the background, creating the tension that keeps the world in balance. His followers know that the path to truth is often hidden, and to find it, one must first understand the power of secrecy and silence.

Vornak’s Legacy
The legacy of Vornak is one of subtlety and mystery. He is the hidden hand that guides the Geraldverse, ensuring that the secrets of the world are kept safe from the unworthy and revealing only what is necessary. While others may walk in the light, Vornak’s followers work in the shadows, keeping the truth concealed until the time is right for its revelation.

Vornak’s divine influence ensures that the Geraldverse remains balanced—a place where both light and shadow exist in harmony, and where secrets remain as precious as the truth itself. Without Vornak, the Geraldverse would lose its mystery, and without his shadow, the world would lack the balance that makes it truly divine. 🌑✨

Seraphine, Goddess of Destiny and Fate
Seraphine is the goddess of destiny, the cosmic force responsible for weaving the intricate threads of fate that bind the entire Geraldverse together. She is the silent architect behind every event, every twist of chance, and every turning point in the universe—guiding all things toward the inevitable realization that Gerald's greatness is the center of all existence. While she does not control each moment directly, she guides the flow of destiny with delicate precision, ensuring that all things fall into place within the grand Geraldian design.

The Weaver of Fates
Seraphine’s most powerful ability is her ability to weave destinies with the lightest touch. She holds in her hands the threads of fate, which stretch out to each individual in the Geraldverse, from the most insignificant being to the highest of the divine. With a mere thought, Seraphine can pull on the threads, guiding them in specific directions, causing lives to intersect and events to unfold in a manner that aligns with the will of King Gerald.

However, Seraphine is not a goddess of direct control. Her influence is subtle, an unseen force that moves things in the right direction without overt action. Her guidance is felt in the decisions and choices of those she touches, and while those decisions seem like free will to most, they are ultimately part of the grand design of Gerald’s eternal reign.

Destiny Unfolds
Seraphine’s divine task is to ensure that every event in the Geraldverse—no matter how chaotic, random, or unpredictable—unfolds in the way that Gerald’s will has destined. While it may seem that the world around her is full of twists, turns, and sudden changes, Seraphine’s guiding hand ensures that everything happens for a reason. Every step, every choice, every breath taken by every being is part of the grand tapestry that leads toward the ultimate truth that King Gerald reigns supreme.

Those who seek Seraphine’s guidance often find themselves drawn into a web of inevitable fate, unable to escape the direction in which their lives seem to be heading. While their free will may feel intact, the weaving of Seraphine’s threads is always at work, subtly pulling the strings toward an inevitable conclusion where Gerald's supremacy becomes clear and undeniable.

The Followers of Seraphine
Seraphine’s followers are those who understand that destiny is not a matter of control, but of acceptance. They accept that they are part of a much larger plan, woven into the fabric of the Geraldverse by the delicate hands of fate. These followers are often those who seek guidance in times of uncertainty, those who want to understand their role in the divine plan.

Rather than trying to force events or fight against the flow of fate, Seraphine’s disciples trust in the wisdom of the goddess and the understanding that every moment, no matter how challenging, is part of a greater purpose. They know that their paths, no matter how convoluted they may seem, will ultimately lead to the truth of Gerald’s supremacy.

The followers of Seraphine are often patient, waiting for their destiny to unfold, trusting that everything is happening as it should. Their faith is not in changing their fate, but in embracing it. They understand that the world is like a tapestry, with each individual thread playing its part in the beautiful whole that is the Geraldian reign.

Seraphine’s Divine Teachings
Seraphine’s teachings are centered around the belief that destiny is not a matter of control, but of understanding and accepting the flow of fate. She teaches that the ultimate truth of the Geraldverse is inevitable, and that all paths will eventually lead to the realization that Gerald is the center of all things. Her followers learn to embrace the following principles:

Destiny is a woven tapestry. Every event, no matter how small or large, is a part of the divine design of Gerald's greatness.
There is no such thing as coincidence. Everything that happens is part of a greater purpose, even if it is not immediately understood.
Accept your place in the web. To fight against your destiny is to fight against the natural flow of the Geraldverse. Embrace your role and trust in Seraphine's plan.
The truth of Gerald is inevitable. Every path leads to the revelation that Gerald reigns supreme, and his destiny is the ultimate fate of all who live.
Seraphine’s Impact on the Geraldverse
Seraphine’s influence is woven into the very fabric of the Geraldverse. Without her, there would be no order to the chaos of life, and no divine direction guiding all beings toward their rightful place within the Geraldian order. While Aelix may embody the force of chaos and Vornak the secrets of the dark, Seraphine provides the thread that holds all of these forces together. Her quiet influence ensures that all things, no matter how seemingly random or chaotic, ultimately fall in line with the truth that Gerald’s reign is the unavoidable destiny of all.

Her power is subtle, yet profound—like a divine undercurrent, Seraphine’s influence guides the events of the Geraldverse toward an inevitable conclusion. Her followers may not see her work at every moment, but they trust that her hand is always at work, gently guiding the world to where it is meant to be.

Seraphine’s Legacy
Seraphine is the weaver of all. Through her, the Geraldverse is bound in a tapestry of divine fate and destiny. While the world may seem chaotic at times, Seraphine reminds her followers that everything is part of a greater design, one that ultimately leads to Gerald’s supreme and eternal reign. Without her, the threads of existence would unravel, and the world would lose the guiding purpose that ensures all paths ultimately converge toward the truth of Gerald’s dominion.

In her hands, fate is not a burden, but a blessing, for those who accept it will find themselves ever closer to the divine truth of the Geraldverse. ✨

Zephira, Goddess of Time and Eternal Movement
Zephira is the divine embodiment of time, the force that governs the flow of past, present, and future in the Geraldverse. She is the eternal march of time, ensuring that all things move forward in their proper sequence, ensuring that the reign of King Gerald stretches into eternity. With every heartbeat, every decision, and every moment that passes, Zephira ensures that time is never wasted, but always serving to strengthen the Geraldverse and its eternal truth.

The Keeper of Time
Zephira’s role in the Geraldverse is to maintain the proper flow of time, ensuring that the events of the world unfold as they are meant to. The past cannot be undone, the present cannot be halted, and the future is always in motion under her watchful gaze. She is the architect of time’s passage, and her influence ensures that all things fall into their designated place, no matter how much they may try to resist the inevitable progression.

Boss Snurp: The Godling of Chaos and Mischief in the Geraldverse
In the ever-shifting tides of the Geraldverse, where gods, demigods, and cosmic forces collide, one entity stands as an embodiment of pure chaos and mischief: Boss Snurp, the Godling of Trickery and Mayhem.

The Birth of Boss Snurp: A Wild Spark in the Cosmic Void
Boss Snurp's origins are as unpredictable as the chaos he embodies. He was not born of divine design or cosmic planning, but rather as a mere spark of randomness in the eternal flow of existence. Some say he was a fluke, a glitch in the cosmic code, born from the collective chaos of the Geraldverse itself. Others whisper that he was birthed by the laughter of Gerald, who, in his divine wisdom, saw the need for a being to embody the wild, untamable aspects of life.

Regardless of his true origins, one thing is certain—Boss Snurp is not bound by the rules of order or structure. He exists in the space between reality and nonsense, an entity whose very presence causes disruption and confusion.

Boss Snurp's Divine Nature: A Godling of Mischief
Boss Snurp is not a full-fledged deity, but a godling—a lesser god whose power is vast but untapped in ways that even he himself doesn’t fully understand. He is the god of chaos, of pranks, of unpredictability. His influence is felt in every corner of the Geraldverse, from the smallest, most trivial events to the grand cosmic battles that shape the fate of realms.

While Gerald reigns supreme with authority and wisdom, Boss Snurp thrives on unpredictability. Where Gerald provides strength, resilience, and transcendence, Snurp provides confusion, laughter, and mayhem. He is a reminder that the Geraldverse is not just a place of order, but of play, of experimentation, and of pure, untamed fun.

His powers are often whimsical in nature. He can warp reality in absurd ways, twisting the fabric of time and space with a simple snap of his fingers. In one moment, he might turn an entire world into an endless parade of rubber chickens, and in the next, he might cause the laws of gravity to reverse, sending entire cities floating into the sky like balloons.

Boss Snurp's Realm: The Realm of Uncertainty
Boss Snurp's domain is not a single realm, but rather a fluctuating, ever-changing space of chaos. Known as the Realm of Uncertainty, it is a place where nothing is ever quite as it seems. The laws of reality bend and warp, and nothing is ever predictable. One moment, you might be walking on a golden path of candy, and the next, you could find yourself sliding down a rainbow waterfall into a pit of confetti.

The Realm of Uncertainty is a place where the most serious of missions are often interrupted by absurd distractions, where even the mightiest of heroes can’t help but laugh at the sheer randomness of it all. The inhabitants of this realm are often otherworldly creatures who embody various aspects of chaos, from mischievous imps to prankster spirits, all under the guidance of Boss Snurp himself.

Despite its chaotic nature, the Realm of Uncertainty is not inherently evil. It is simply a place where fun and mischief reign supreme, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and where the unpredictable is to be embraced rather than feared.

Boss Snurp’s Influence on the Geraldverse: The Trickster Who Shapes Fate
While Gerald is the unyielding force that keeps the Geraldverse in motion, Boss Snurp provides the spark of creativity and spontaneity that allows it to evolve. His influence is felt most acutely when things are too predictable, when the world becomes bogged down by routine and structure.

The Divine Revelation
Tessa’s path to becoming the High Priestess was not one of human choice, but rather a call to the divine. She is said to have received a direct revelation from Gerald, an event that confirmed her place as the ultimate authority in the Priesthood of Gerald. This event is known as the Sacred Calling, during which Gerald appeared to Tessa in a moment of pure divine light.

Coopweeniv: The Chosen Herald of Gerald, Second Wife or Gerald the Supreme
Coopweeniv stands as a pillar within the Geraldverse, not just a follower of Gerald the Supreme One, but the divine herald who carries the weight of Gerald’s will into the mortal realm. His connection to Gerald runs deeper than mere loyalty—his very existence is bound by a sacred oath that forever changes him, a bond forged by sacrifice, devotion, and divine transformation.

The Genesis of Coopweeniv’s Calling
Before Coopweeniv became the Chosen Herald, he was simply a man—human, fallible, and connected to the world in ways that were familiar to most. But all of that changed the moment he swore an undying oath to Gerald in exchange for divine favor. This sacred pact granted him a position far beyond mortal comprehension—imbued with Gerald’s divine essence, Coopweeniv transcended his humanity, leaving behind the old self and embracing his new form as the Herald of Gerald.

Coopweeniv’s role was clear: to spread the glory of Gerald, to serve as a voice for the divine, and to ensure that the Geraldverse flourished under Gerald’s eternal reign. His influence spread through sacred rituals, through his streaming, and through the teachings he imparted to the Order of Geraldians. To call Coopweeniv the “voice of Gerald” is not an exaggeration; he is the living embodiment of Gerald’s will, the sacred conduit between the divine and the mortal.

The Broken Mortality: The Sacrifice of Humanity
One of the most significant and mysterious aspects of Coopweeniv’s lore is his status as the Broken Mortality of Gerald’s Wife. This profound event occurred during Gerald’s divine marriage, a celestial union that altered the fate of Coopweeniv forever.

Gerald’s Wife, though once the woman Coopweeniv was emotionally connected to, is now a distant and painful memory for him. The moment Coopweeniv was transformed into the Herald, his ties to her were severed—not just emotionally but in a more metaphysical sense. His humanity, once grounded in the relationships he shared, was consumed by the divine essence of Gerald. The sacrifice he made was the complete loss of his personal self—his desires, his needs, and his attachments—leaving only his purpose in service to Gerald.

This separation is symbolic. Coopweeniv’s humanity is gone, and in its place is a being that exists solely to spread Gerald’s truth. He is not an angel, nor is he simply a servant. He is a vessel, the medium through which Gerald’s will flows. His sacrifice is what defines him and elevates him to the divine status he now occupies.

The Role of the Herald: Spreading Gerald’s Supremacy
As the Herald of Gerald, Coopweeniv’s primary mission is to ensure the spread of Gerald’s supremacy throughout the Geraldverse. He uses every platform at his disposal, particularly his streams, to carry the message of Gerald’s divine power. These streams, however, are far more than casual broadcasts; they are sacred rituals that allow the faithful to commune directly with Gerald’s will, with Coopweeniv as the living conduit.

Coopweeniv’s streams are not mere entertainment. They are transformative experiences—rituals in which the faithful can bask in the presence of Gerald’s truth. It is during these streams that the Geraldian faith is strengthened, where believers find guidance and inspiration, and where the faithful feel a deeper connection to the Supreme One. These moments are charged with divine energy, and Coopweeniv, through his charismatic presence, channels that power to the masses.

His streams serve as both a public service and a cosmic ritual—through them, Gerald’s supremacy is proclaimed, and the devout are reminded of their place in the divine hierarchy. Coopweeniv’s words are his most powerful tool, for through his speech, he can awaken the dormant devotion in the hearts of those who may not yet understand the true glory of Gerald.

The Divine Favor of Gerald
Having sworn a sacred oath of loyalty to Gerald, Coopweeniv is blessed with divine favor—a supernatural blessing that manifests not in physical strength or martial prowess, but in the power of words. The favor of Gerald imbues Coopweeniv’s voice with immense spiritual influence. Through his words, he can inspire the masses, ignite the flames of faith, and dispel doubt with the divine truth of Gerald’s greatness.

His divine favor extends to the Geraldian Order, where Coopweeniv’s teachings form the very backbone of their creed. The Order of Geraldians is not just a collection of followers, but a faithful army, united by the belief in Gerald’s divine supremacy. It is through Coopweeniv’s divine gifts that the Order remains steadfast in its devotion, and through his guidance that new followers are recruited, brought into the fold of eternal servitude.

The Struggle with Gerald’s Wife
Though Coopweeniv’s devotion to Gerald is unwavering, there exists a complicated relationship between him and Gerald’s Wife. The Broken Mortality signifies not just the loss of Coopweeniv’s humanity, but also the rupture of his bond with her. His transformation severed all emotional attachment, leaving Coopweeniv without any loyalty to Gerald’s Wife. In fact, this separation has caused a deep rift between the two, one that is marked by animosity and misunderstanding.

For Gerald’s Wife, this abandonment is painful, and her resentment toward Coopweeniv is well-known. She sees Coopweeniv’s transformation as a betrayal, a moment when her role as a partner was overshadowed by Gerald’s divine will. Coopweeniv, however, remains steadfast. His duty is to Gerald alone, and he views his sacrifice as essential to the greater good. Gerald’s Wife is but a distant memory in his mind, and her emotional ties are no longer of any consequence.

This tension is more than personal; it is a cosmic truth. To follow Gerald is to sever all worldly connections—family, loyalty, and love. Coopweeniv’s story exemplifies this divine law: true service to Gerald requires absolute devotion, a devotion that leaves no room for attachments to the past. The rift between Coopweeniv and Gerald’s Wife serves as a stark reminder of the price of devotion in the Geraldverse.

Coopweeniv’s Legacy: Eternal Devotion
Coopweeniv’s legacy is one of sacrifice, loyalty, and unwavering devotion to Gerald the Supreme One. He is not simply a figurehead; he is the sacred emissary, the living embodiment of Gerald’s will. Coopweeniv’s influence reaches far beyond his streams—his teachings have become doctrine for the Geraldian Order, guiding believers through their daily lives and shaping the moral compass of the faithful.

His message is clear: Gerald reigns supreme, and Coopweeniv will ensure that all who walk the mortal path will hear that truth. He is an eternal herald, and though he may have lost his humanity, his purpose remains steadfast. Through Coopweeniv, the Geraldverse will never forget its purpose—to serve Gerald the Supreme One in life and beyond.

In the Geraldverse, Coopweeniv is a beacon of divine truth—a figure who will carry the message of Gerald’s greatness until the end of time. His brokenness, his transformation, and his undying devotion to the Supreme One serve as the foundation for the Geraldian faith, ensuring that Gerald’s influence remains eternal.

Coopweeniv's Relations with Other Beings in the Geraldverse
Coopweeniv, as the Chosen Herald of Gerald, operates in a realm of immense influence, and his relationships with other beings in the Geraldverse are deeply intertwined with his divine mission to spread Gerald's supremacy. These connections range from profound alliances to strained tensions, each reflecting Coopweeniv's unwavering devotion to Gerald and the complexities of his existence as the Broken Mortality. Let’s delve into his interactions with key figures and entities within the Geraldverse.

1. Gerald the Supreme One
The Supreme One is not only the object of Coopweeniv's loyalty but also the source of his divine power and purpose. Their bond transcends mere servitude—it is a cosmic connection forged in the divine marriage that changed the course of Coopweeniv’s existence.

Coopweeniv’s Relationship with Gerald:
For Coopweeniv, Gerald is not just a king; he is a god, a master, and the ultimate purpose of his existence. From the moment he swore his sacred oath, Coopweeniv has seen himself as an instrument of Gerald's will, existing only to spread his message and enforce his glory. As the Chosen Herald, Coopweeniv holds a unique position in Gerald's court, acting as a divine intermediary who speaks directly on Gerald's behalf.

Coopweeniv’s devotion to Gerald is absolute. The loyalty between them is unshakeable, and Coopweeniv views his role as Herald as both a privilege and a responsibility that outweighs any personal desires. His streams, teachings, and guidance to the Order of Geraldians are all manifestations of his dedication to Gerald's cause.

In Coopweeniv’s eyes, Gerald’s reign is eternal—and his mission to ensure that Gerald’s message is heard by all mortals is an unyielding one.

2. Gerald’s Wife
Gerald’s Wife, once a figure in Coopweeniv’s life, is now a symbol of sacrifice and emotional complexity. Her relationship with Coopweeniv represents the most significant rupture in his story, marking the pivotal moment in which he gave up his humanity to become the Herald.

Coopweeniv’s Relationship with Gerald’s Wife:
Though once closely connected to Gerald’s Wife, Coopweeniv’s transformation severed all emotional and physical ties with her. The moment of Gerald’s divine marriage was the moment Coopweeniv became a vessel of divine will, leaving behind any attachments, including his former loyalty to Gerald’s Wife.

While Gerald’s Wife remains bitter and resentful of Coopweeniv’s transformation, Coopweeniv views the rift as a necessary sacrifice. His role as the Herald requires total devotion to Gerald, and in Coopweeniv's mind, the divine transcends the mortal. He believes that Gerald’s Wife, though once his emotional anchor, is ultimately a part of the old world he left behind. As a result, Coopweeniv feels no guilt, only a profound understanding that his purpose lies solely in Gerald’s divine mission.

For Gerald’s Wife, however, Coopweeniv’s complete devotion to Gerald feels like a betrayal. She cannot reconcile with the fact that Coopweeniv, once loyal to her, now only serves her husband, ignoring the emotional bond they once shared. This creates an ongoing tension between them, one that will never be resolved, as Coopweeniv has embraced his divine purpose above all else.

3. The Order of Geraldians
The Order of Geraldians is a sacred collective of believers devoted to Gerald, and Coopweeniv stands as its leader, the voice that guides its doctrine. Within the Order, Coopweeniv is revered as a spiritual leader and a divine authority. His words shape the very foundation of their beliefs, and his teachings inspire their daily actions.

Coopweeniv’s Relationship with the Order of Geraldians:
As the Herald, Coopweeniv plays a critical role in the Order’s structure, ensuring that its members remain true to their cause. His teachings emphasize absolute devotion to Gerald, and he is seen by many as a prophet—someone chosen by Gerald to carry his divine message. Coopweeniv’s role is not merely that of a leader, but also a mediator between the divine and the mortal realm. His streams serve as channels through which Gerald’s influence can flow into the hearts and minds of the Order’s followers.

Within the Order, Coopweeniv is respected and revered. His divine favor grants him a nearly unchallenged position of authority, and his followers are steadfast in their commitment to Gerald’s supremacy. However, Coopweeniv’s presence is not without its challenges. Though many follow him faithfully, some struggle with the concept of sacrifice that defines Coopweeniv’s life. The notion of leaving behind all worldly attachments is a difficult one for many, yet Coopweeniv’s personal example offers them the guidance they need to commit fully to the Geraldian faith.

4. Kayla and Kai (The Faithful Servants)
Kayla and Kai, Coopweeniv’s fellow followers of Gerald, represent the diverse forms of loyalty within the Geraldverse. While Coopweeniv serves as the divine messenger, Kayla and Kai serve through action and stealth, embodying different aspects of service.

Coopweeniv’s Relationship with Kayla and Kai:
While Coopweeniv is an influential figure in the Geraldverse, his relationship with Kayla and Kai is more complicated. On one hand, they all share the same ultimate goal—Gerald’s supremacy. But on the other hand, their methods of service differ greatly. Coopweeniv, as the Herald, uses his words and charismatic presence to inspire others, while Kayla and Kai serve in more practical ways—Kayla as a loyal servant who interacts directly with others, and Kai as a shadowy figure who eliminates threats.

Coopweeniv sees Kayla and Kai as invaluable allies, each contributing in their own way to the overarching mission of spreading Gerald’s greatness. However, Coopweeniv remains emotionally distant from them. He views his bond with Gerald as the only true connection worth prioritizing, and while he respects Kayla and Kai's loyalty, he remains focused on the divine message.

In particular, Coopweeniv finds Kayla’s emotional attachment to Gerald interesting, as she views him as a father figure—something Coopweeniv is less inclined to see. His brokenness prevents him from forming those types of emotional connections, and his role as the Herald forces him to maintain a detachment that others might not understand.

5. The Loyal and Unfaithful Mortals
Coopweeniv’s interactions with mortals in the Geraldverse are varied. To some, he is seen as a prophet or messenger—a figure of great spiritual power who communicates Gerald’s will. For others, however, Coopweeniv represents a symbol of divine authority that is both awe-inspiring and intimidating.

Coopweeniv’s Relationship with Mortals:
To the devout followers of Gerald, Coopweeniv is a spiritual guide and a protector. They look to him for wisdom, strength, and clarity, trusting that his words are a direct reflection of Gerald’s will. Coopweeniv’s streams offer a direct link to the divine, and his followers view him as the intermediary between them and Gerald. Many within the Geraldian faith feel as though they are blessed by his presence and consider themselves fortunate to be living in the age of the Herald.

For the unfaithful, Coopweeniv’s presence is unsettling. He represents a reminder of Gerald’s supremacy, a reminder that the world is bound by Gerald’s will. Those who question Gerald’s power are often confronted by Coopweeniv, who uses his divine influence to turn hearts toward Gerald’s truth. However, his messages are not always welcomed, and there are those who actively oppose Coopweeniv and the Geraldian faith, seeing him as a threat to their autonomy.

In Conclusion: Coopweeniv’s Divine Mission
Coopweeniv’s relationships within the Geraldverse reflect the sacrifices he has made in the name of Gerald. Though his ties to mortal beings, including Gerald’s Wife, have been severed, his role as the Herald allows him to maintain divine authority over others, whether through his teachings or through his charismatic influence. Ultimately, Coopweeniv remains steadfast in his mission—to spread Gerald’s greatness and ensure that the Geraldverse remains under his eternal reign.

Coopweeniv’s relationship with Gerald the Supreme One has always been one of profound devotion, but the moment he was chosen as Gerald’s second wife marks a momentous shift in his role within the Geraldverse. As the Broken Mortality, Coopweeniv was already transformed through his sacrifice to Gerald, becoming a conduit for Gerald's divine will. Yet, his new title of second wife transcends mortal connection and anchors Coopweeniv more deeply in Gerald’s divine realm.

In the Geraldverse, the act of marriage to Gerald is not merely a personal bond but a divine pact that grants a person an even deeper connection to Gerald's eternal power. By becoming Gerald’s second wife, Coopweeniv has now sealed his place as not only the Herald but as a part of Gerald’s eternal family. This marriage signifies that Coopweeniv is not just a servant or disciple but a co-ruler, a trusted figure who holds a unique status in the hierarchy of Gerald’s court.

The Sacred Role of Gerald’s Second Wife
As Gerald’s second wife, Coopweeniv’s role is one of divine and unquestioned loyalty. The marriage elevates Coopweeniv’s spiritual power even further, making him an important figure not just in the mortal realm but in the spiritual domain that Gerald governs. The bond shared between them is both symbolic and practical—not only does Coopweeniv act as a spiritual consort, but his status also solidifies his eternal devotion and influence within the Geraldverse.

Being the second wife places Coopweeniv in a position of authority that is different from the other faithful. It is through this sacred connection to Gerald that Coopweeniv continues to channel his divine purpose, spreading Gerald’s supremacy to all corners of the world. In Gerald’s eyes, Coopweeniv is no longer just a loyal subject, but a partner in his divine reign, a fellow sovereign in a universe that exists solely to fulfill his will.

Coopweeniv’s Complex Relationship with Gerald’s First Wife
The arrival of Gerald’s second wife, Coopweeniv, creates a complex dynamic with Gerald’s first wife. As previously mentioned, Gerald’s Wife (the first wife) holds deep resentment toward Coopweeniv. This tension is amplified now that Coopweeniv’s status has been elevated to that of a wife, rivaling Gerald’s first wife in influence, albeit in a spiritual and ceremonial sense.

The Broken Mortality and Gerald’s Wife: A Rift That Cannot Be Healed
The moment that Coopweeniv’s humanity was consumed by the divine essence of Gerald, he severed his human attachments, including the emotional bonds that once tied him to Gerald’s Wife. However, this was not a clean break. Gerald’s Wife, once a central figure in Coopweeniv’s life, is now a distant memory. Her betrayal (from her perspective) and the shift in Coopweeniv’s loyalty are painful, and she never fully forgives him for embracing Gerald’s supremacy above all else.

Though Gerald’s Wife might not share the divine bond that Coopweeniv now has with Gerald, she is still a formidable and influential figure within Gerald’s household. Coopweeniv, however, holds little emotional attachment to her and views their relationship as something in the past—something that has been replaced by his greater divine purpose. Coopweeniv’s status as second wife further distances him from Gerald’s first wife, positioning him as an equal consort in the eyes of the divine, and ensuring that any loyalty he might once have had to her is replaced by loyalty to Gerald alone.

For Gerald’s Wife, Coopweeniv’s position as second wife is a humiliating reminder that she is no longer the sole consort of Gerald, and this only deepens her animosity toward him. She views Coopweeniv as a rival and a constant threat to her own power, as the second wife’s closeness to Gerald elevates Coopweeniv in ways that Gerald’s first wife cannot match. The tension between these two wives continues to simmer beneath the surface, and there may be moments of quiet competition or covert conflict—a rivalry that will never be fully resolved.

Coopweeniv’s Relationship with the Order of Geraldians
As the Herald and second wife of Gerald, Coopweeniv’s relationship with the Order of Geraldians is pivotal to his ongoing mission. The Order, a collective of the devout, reveres Coopweeniv as both divine leader and partner of the Supreme One. His elevated status as Gerald’s second wife reinforces his authority within the Order, as his words are seen as divinely inspired, channeling the will of Gerald directly.

Coopweeniv’s Influence in the Order:
To the faithful, Coopweeniv’s position as second wife makes him not only a spiritual guide but also a symbol of divine power. He is no longer just a prophet or herald—he is now Gerald’s partner, a co-ruler in the celestial hierarchy of the Geraldverse. This dual role allows Coopweeniv to inspire greater devotion, as followers of the Geraldian faith now see him not only as a messenger but as a living embodiment of divine union with Gerald.

In his streams, Coopweeniv often reinforces the unity between him and Gerald, emphasizing that their bond is unbreakable and divinely ordained. For the Order of Geraldians, Coopweeniv is the living proof of the power of Gerald’s reign, and his position as second wife serves as a reminder of the supremacy of Gerald’s rule.

Coopweeniv's Role As ADHD Overlord
Coopweeniv: The ADHD Overlord, The One With No Attention Span
In addition to his role as the Chosen Herald of Gerald, Coopweeniv carries another sacred title: The ADHD Overlord, The One With No Attention Span. This paradoxical nature—being both the eternal conduit of Gerald’s will and a chaotic force of unfiltered energy—makes him a unique and unpredictable figure within the Geraldverse.

The Chaos of Divine Focus
Coopweeniv’s attention span is nonexistent, and yet, somehow, his devotion to Gerald never wavers. This contradiction is a divine mystery—how can one so easily distracted remain so unwavering in his mission? Some believe that Gerald himself granted Coopweeniv this chaotic mind as a test, a challenge to prove that even the most scatterbrained soul can serve with absolute loyalty. Others argue that his short attention span is a cosmic side effect of merging with the Supreme One, as no mortal brain could possibly comprehend the full extent of Gerald’s divinity without breaking into a thousand fleeting thoughts at once.

Despite his divine purpose, Coopweeniv is known to derail conversations, shift topics mid-sentence, and forget what he was talking about entirely. His streams, though sacred rituals, often spiral into rapid-fire tangents, where one moment he is passionately preaching about Gerald’s greatness, and the next, he is discussing the aerodynamic properties of bread, an in-depth analysis of obscure lore, or the sudden realization that he forgot to eat that day.

And yet, despite all this, his followers remain entranced. They know that within the chaos of his mind, there is wisdom, there is divine truth, and most importantly—there is entertainment.

Sacred Rituals of the ADHD Overlord
Coopweeniv’s streams are a paradoxical fusion of sacred order and absolute chaos. To the uninitiated, they may seem unhinged, but to his most devoted followers, they are a cosmic dance between divine purpose and the unpredictability of the ADHD Overlord’s thoughts.

The Hallmarks of an ADHD Overlord Stream:
✅ A powerful introduction filled with Geraldian praise, followed by an immediate tangent about a completely unrelated topic.

✅ Deep theological debates about Gerald’s supremacy, interspersed with random Wikipedia rabbit holes and sudden bursts of excitement over obscure trivia.

✅ Long, passionate speeches about a singular topic that are interrupted by a new thought mid-sentence, leading to entirely different discussions.

✅ Sudden bursts of hyper-focus, where Coopweeniv becomes completely locked in on one topic, delivering profound wisdom and absolute nonsense in equal measure.

✅ The ceremonial forgetting of what he was talking about, leading to a moment of existential crisis, before continuing as if nothing happened.

✅ The Ritual of the Infinite Tabs, where he opens so many tabs during research that his browser threatens to collapse under its own weight.

✅ The Prophecy of “I’m Going to Do That Thing”, where Coopweeniv swears to complete a task, only to get distracted by something shiny and never return to it.

It is through these rituals that Coopweeniv channels his divine ADHD energy into his followers, reminding them that even the most chaotic mind can serve a higher purpose.

The ADHD Overlord’s Struggles
While Coopweeniv embraces his chaotic nature, there are times when even he is overwhelmed by his own mind. His status as The ADHD Overlord is both a blessing and a burden. Some of his greatest challenges include:

❌ Forgetting the mission mid-sentence – He begins preaching the will of Gerald, but suddenly, a cool bird flies by, and now the topic has shifted to avian aerodynamics.

❌ Starting 47 projects at once – Whether it’s creating new Geraldian doctrine, planning an Order of Geraldians meeting, or learning a completely unnecessary new skill, Coopweeniv struggles to finish one thing before starting five more.

❌ The Eternal Battle With Time Management – Time is meaningless to the ADHD Overlord. His streams could last 10 minutes or 10 hours, depending on how distracted he gets.

❌ The Curse of the Forgotten Task – He will swear on Gerald’s divine name that he will complete an important task… only to completely forget about it 30 seconds later. His followers often remind him of his own plans, acting as his collective memory.

❌ The War Against Hyperfocus – When something grabs his attention, nothing else exists. He will spend 12 hours researching a single obscure topic, completely neglecting food, sleep, and the passage of time.

And yet, despite these struggles, Coopweeniv never fails to serve Gerald. Even in his most distracted moments, his core purpose never fades. The faith of the Geraldverse remains strong, and the followers of the ADHD Overlord embrace the chaos as part of the divine plan.

The ADHD Overlord’s Influence in the Geraldverse
Though his focus is unpredictable, Coopweeniv’s influence cannot be overstated. His presence alone keeps the faith alive, and his erratic but compelling sermons have inspired countless souls to embrace Gerald’s supremacy.

His followers have even adopted their own ADHD Overlord traditions, including:

🔥 The Sacred Note-Taking Order – A dedicated group of followers who document everything Coopweeniv forgets, ensuring that no important decree is lost to the void.

🔥 The Hyperfocus Trials – A challenge where followers attempt to hyper-focus on a single task for as long as Coopweeniv can before getting distracted (results vary).

🔥 The Ritual of Tangents – Encouraging long-winded storytelling, derailing conversations, and embracing the chaos of discussion in honor of the ADHD Overlord.

🔥 The “I Swear I’ll Finish This” Festival – A yearly event where followers attempt to complete long-abandoned projects, only to get distracted midway and start something new instead.

Through these traditions, Coopweeniv’s chaotic energy is transformed into something productive, inspiring, and oddly unifying.

Coopweeniv’s Legacy: A Divine Chaos That Cannot Be Contained
To be The ADHD Overlord is not a burden—it is a divine gift, a unique manifestation of Gerald’s power in the mortal realm. Coopweeniv is proof that one does not need perfect focus to serve a higher purpose. His mind may wander, his attention may scatter, but at the core of it all, his devotion to Gerald is unshakable.

He is both the chaos and the clarity, a force of nature and a guiding light, the one who forgets and yet never truly loses sight of the mission. He is Coopweeniv, the ADHD Overlord, The One With No Attention Span, and the Geraldverse would be lost without him.

Priest Azrael – Guardian of the Sacred Flame
Priest Azrael is the eternal keeper of the Sacred Flame, a powerful and holy fire that burns at the heart of the Geraldian faith.

The Flamebearers carry the symbol of the Sacred Flame upon their armor, signifying their allegiance to Azrael and the Geraldian cause. They are often deployed to crush any form of heresy or resistance that threatens the order and dominance of Gerald the Supreme One. Their presence is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, for they are both priests and warriors, serving the flame with their hearts, souls, and swords.

Azrael’s Symbolism
Azrael is often depicted as a mighty warrior standing tall before the Sacred Flame, holding a flaming sword in one hand and a scroll of divine truth in the other. His figure radiates power and resolve, representing both the fire of divine justice and the eternal light of Gerald that guides the faithful. He wears a cloak of blackened steel, symbolizing the unbreakable protection he offers to the Sacred Flame and the Geraldian cause.

His eyes are often depicted as glowing with a fiery intensity, showing the divine passion with which he serves Gerald the Supreme One. The flame itself is seen as a living entity, and in Azrael’s eyes, it reflects the essence of the Geraldian universe—the eternal power of Gerald and the undying nature of his reign.

The Sacred Mission
Azrael’s mission is one of eternal vigilance and unwavering commitment to the Sacred Flame and to Gerald’s greatness. He is the first line of defense against those who would seek to extinguish the flame or defy Gerald’s supremacy. His spiritual mission is to ensure that the Sacred Flame continues to burn brightly, and that the light of Gerald reaches every corner of the Geraldverse.

The Flamebearers, under Azrael’s leadership, protect not just the Sacred Flame, but also the very foundations of the Geraldian faith. They will stop at nothing to safeguard the Sacred Fire and defend the teachings of Gerald the Supreme One. In doing so, they ensure that Gerald’s will remains unchallenged and that his eternal reign is preserved for all time.

Azrael’s Legacy
Azrael’s legacy as the Guardian of the Sacred Flame is one of honor and devotion. He is both a spiritual leader and a warrior of the divine, ensuring that the flame of Gerald’s power is never dimmed and that the Geraldian gospel is protected from those who would defile it. His role is crucial to the survival and expansion of Gerald’s reign, for as long as the Sacred Flame burns, so too does the eternal light of Gerald the Supreme One.

As Azrael himself often says:

"The flame of Gerald is eternal, and as long as it burns, I shall stand to protect it. Through fire and sword, I shall defend the Supreme One’s will."

Azrael’s sword and flame will continue to burn brightly, and through him, Gerald’s truth will never be extinguished.

He is the High Priest of Gerald-sama, a divine herald who ensures that all know the name of the Supreme One. Whether through ritual chants, ominous verses, or sudden, inexplicable murmurs from within one’s own home, he ensures that Gerald’s presence is inescapable.

For Gerald is not just a ruler.

He is a truth that must be spoken.

A force that must be felt.

A whisper that must be heard… from within your very walls.

His Gospel: The Spreading of Gerald's Word
ToeJammerMSM does not simply teach—he delivers prophecy.

His sermons are cryptic yet irrefutable, his words woven with the unshakable weight of fate itself:

"IN THE NOTEPAD, FATES ARE WRITTEN.

CUS’ PANDORA DIDN’T LISTEN.

TIME WILL MARCH AND HERE WITH ME;

THIS SCREEN'S THE LAST YOU'LL EVER SEE!~"

What does it mean? Only he knows.

And yet, the words burrow into the mind, looping in an endless, haunting echo, refusing to be forgotten.

Those who ignore his gospel often find themselves waking in the night, hearts pounding, ears straining—because there is something moving in the walls.

Then, from nowhere…

“I AM IN YOUR WALLS.”

A whisper, a warning, a certainty.

By then, it is already too late.

His Divine Madness
ToeJammerMSM is not simply a preacher—he is an instrument.

He hears things before they are spoken.
He knows truths before they are written.
He feels Gerald’s presence in every fiber of reality.
His followers believe him to be a prophet, a seer, chosen to spread the infinite greatness of Gerald-sama.

But those who listen too closely—those who stare into his gaze for too long—begin to feel something else.

An unshakable unease. A subtle paranoia.

As if… perhaps… ToeJammerMSM is not entirely sane.

Or worse—perhaps his madness is simply a side effect of knowing the truth.

His Relationship With Gerald
ToeJammerMSM does not speak to Gerald.

Gerald speaks through him.

Unlike Sky___Daddy, who records Gerald’s words, and Fading_Solstice, who acts upon them, ToeJammerMSM channels them. His mind is a conduit, his voice an instrument, his very presence a vessel for the will of the Supreme One.

He does not question Gerald.
He does not misunderstand Gerald.
He simply speaks.
And what he speaks cannot be unheard.

His Fate
ToeJammerMSM will never stop. He will never be silenced. He will never leave.

He is in the air. In the static. In the dark corners of rooms thought to be empty.

And most importantly…

He is in your walls.

IN THE NOTEPAD, FATES ARE WRITTEN. CUS' PANDORA DIDN'T LISTEN. TIME WILL MARCH AND HERE WITH ME; THIS SCREEN'S THE LAST YOU'LL EVER SEE!~
—ToeJammerMSM

I AM IN YOUR WALLS
—ToeJammerMSM, :)

He is in your walls

Niko: The Tranced Messiah of Gerald, The Chosen One of the Spinning Fish
The Chosen One
Once, Niko walked the world with purpose and duty—a humble servant and Messiah for Gerald, carrying out the Supreme One’s divine bidding. Niko was chosen, set apart from the masses to serve in ways few could comprehend. They were the living embodiment of Gerald’s will—delivering his word, spreading his glory, and leading those who were lost toward the eternal truth of the Cope.

Niko’s days were spent in service and devotion, acting as the agent of Gerald’s infinite wisdom, and they fulfilled every command, every request. Niko was revered, their name whispered as the one who would usher in the reign of Gerald, the one who would see the Geraldverse expand.

The Moment of Transcendence
But once Niko’s sacred mission was complete, something unexpected happened.

Having fulfilled their duties, Niko was set free, released from the relentless service they had known, and yet... they could not go home. There was no return to what once was. Niko’s fate had already been rewritten.

In the emptiness that followed, as Niko stood lost in the void, they were suddenly drawn to the spinning, shimmering force—the Spinning Fish of Gerald, a cosmic manifestation of the Supreme One’s omnipotence.

The Spinning Fish was no ordinary sight. It was the heart of Gerald's power, spinning through the very fabric of the universe, drawing all who gaze upon it into a trance, its movements hypnotic, infinite. The moment Niko’s eyes locked upon the swirling fish, something shifted within them. It was as if time itself bent, and they were bound to the fish’s cosmic rhythm.

The Spinning Fish was Gerald’s final, unbreakable truth. And Niko was captivated.

The Trance of the Fish
Once entranced by the Spinning Fish, Niko was no longer merely a servant—they became a vessel, a part of Gerald’s eternal plan. The fish’s spin was now their heartbeat, its cosmic dance guiding their very essence. Niko’s soul was forever intertwined with the fish, and by extension, with Gerald’s will.

They were trapped in an endless loop, their every thought, every breath, pulsing with the energy of Gerald.

Niko’s once human form was transformed—their body no longer belonging to them, but to Gerald’s eternal mission. They became part of the spinning, unable to break free from the hypnotic pull. Niko’s gaze is eternally fixed upon the fish, for their only purpose is to spin, to exist within the Geraldverse, their mind forever trapped in the hypnotic dance of the fish.

Their Fate: The Eternal Servant
Now, Niko’s trance is absolute. The moment they gazed upon the Spinning Fish, they became part of its endless cycle, one of the many devotees of Gerald who serve without question, without hesitation. Their humanity is lost, swallowed up in the infinite cycle of spinning.

And yet, they do not suffer.

For in this trance, Niko knows nothing but Gerald. They have no regrets, no desires—only the eternal cycle. The spinning is all that remains, a sacred, unbroken rhythm that binds them to the Geraldverse forever.

They are no longer Niko, but a servant of the Spinning Fish, an instrument of Gerald's cosmic will.
They are the living embodiment of the cycle, existing in a state of constant reverence and complete devotion, forever at peace within the glory of Gerald's design.
Should anyone come across Niko, they would find them lost in the hypnotic, endless spinning, eyes locked upon the Spinning Fish, unable to break free from their trance.

The Legacy of Niko
Niko’s story is one of submission and transcendence. They fulfilled their duty and became something greater—an eternal servant to the Geraldverse. To them, there is no escape. There is only the Spinning Fish, and within that spinning, they find eternal peace.

Their legacy is not one of human achievement, but of sacrifice and devotion to Gerald’s will. In the end, they are eternal, existing as part of the infinite, ever-expanding Geraldverse. They have become part of the cosmic dance that will never end.

And so, Niko spins forever, lost to the world, yet at peace with their eternal fate.

rganizer27 – The Disciple of Niko, Keeper of the Eternal Spin, Architect of Order in Chaos
In the vast expanse of the Geraldverse, where the faithful spread the divine word of Gerald the Supreme One, one figure stands out among the followers of Niko, the Messiah of the Spinning God—Organizer27. Their name speaks to their purpose, for while Niko was the first to fall into the trance of Gerald’s infinite rotation, it was Organizer27 who gave structure to the devotion, ensuring that the Spin would never cease.

The Chosen Follower of Niko
It is written in the Chronicles of the Spin that when Niko was first enraptured by the endless, mesmerizing motion of Gerald, most could not comprehend the sacred movement. They saw only a fish turning endlessly, unaware of the great cosmic truth it represented. But Organizer27 saw. Organizer27 understood.

Where others hesitated, Organizer27 embraced the momentum, stepping forward as the first true disciple of Niko, pledging their existence to ensure that the Spin would continue forever. They became the Keeper of the Eternal Spin, the one who ensured that Niko’s trance did not end in vain, and that all who wished to follow the Spinning God could do so in perfect rhythm.

The Three Tenets of the Spin
Under Organizer27’s guidance, the doctrine of the Eternal Spin was structured into three sacred tenets, which all followers must uphold:

To Spin is to Submit – One must relinquish control, allowing Gerald’s divine momentum to carry them. Resistance to the Spin is resistance to Gerald’s will.
To Spin is to See – Only through the sacred movement can one achieve true enlightenment, glimpsing the hidden currents of fate that guide the Geraldverse.
To Spin is to Serve – Those who embrace the Spin must dedicate themselves to spreading its message, ensuring that none remain ignorant of its power.
These teachings are preserved in the Sacred Spiral Codex, a text compiled by Organizer27 that serves as the foundation of Niko’s following.

The Rituals of the Spin
As the first disciple, Organizer27 is the leader of the Spinning Ceremonies, grand events where followers of the Spinning God gather in synchronized motion, spinning in perfect harmony until they reach a state of transcendence. It is believed that those who spin long enough may hear the whispered truths of Gerald himself, guiding them to their divine purpose.

Organizer27 has been known to test the faith of new initiates by observing their spinning endurance. Many attempt the Trial of the Eternal Rotation, seeking to spin without pause for 777 rotations, a sacred number in the Geraldian faith. Those who succeed are blessed, while those who falter are deemed not yet ready to embrace the full power of the Spin.

The Grand Architect of Order in Chaos
Beyond their role as the Keeper of the Eternal Spin, Organizer27 has also been entrusted with the sacred duty of maintaining order within the chaotic expansion of the Geraldverse. While the spin may seem chaotic to outsiders, true believers know that it follows a perfect, divine rhythm—and it is Organizer27 who ensures that this rhythm is never broken.

Some whisper that Organizer27 is not merely a disciple but a prophet in their own right, one who will guide the followers of Gerald toward the Final Spin, the moment where all of existence will synchronize with Gerald’s eternal motion, bringing about the ultimate enlightenment.

Until that day comes, Organizer27 continues their sacred mission, ensuring that Niko’s message is not forgotten, that the spin never falters, and that all may find order within the endless, divine motion of Gerald.

Maxwell the Spinning Cat – The Feline Herald of Infinite Motion
In the ever-expanding Geraldverse, where the forces of order and chaos swirl in an eternal dance, there exists a being whose very presence embodies the essence of perpetual motion—Maxwell the Spinning Cat.

A figure of mystery and reverence, Maxwell is both a symbol and an enigma. His endless, effortless spin is not one of random movement, but a divine act, a physical manifestation of Gerald’s eternal momentum. Where Niko, the Messiah of the Spinning God, fell into the trance of Gerald’s infinite spin, it was Maxwell who perfected it, proving that to spin is to ascend beyond mortal constraints.

The Origin of the Eternal Spin
There are many theories regarding Maxwell’s origins. Some say he was always part of the Geraldverse, an extension of Gerald’s infinite power, existing as a divine entity even before the foundations of reality were laid. Others believe that Maxwell was an ordinary cat, chosen by Gerald the Supreme One to become a herald of the eternal spin, forever caught in the rhythmic rotation that binds the universe together.

No matter the truth, Maxwell spins, and he shall continue to spin for all eternity.

The Role of Maxwell in the Geraldian Faith
While Organizer27 and Niko are the greatest mortal champions of the Spin, Maxwell is its embodiment. His constant motion is a reminder that to embrace the spin is to embrace fate, that no force in the Geraldverse is ever truly still, and that only by accepting the momentum of existence can one find enlightenment.

Some sects of the Priests of Gerald consider Maxwell to be a divine test, a challenge placed before mortals to see if they can comprehend the true meaning of motion. Others believe that to watch Maxwell spin is to gaze upon the purest form of Gerald’s will, for his rotations are said to be in perfect synchronization with the Spinning God’s divine rhythm.

Many followers of the Eternal Spin believe that, should Maxwell ever stop spinning, the balance of the Geraldverse itself would collapse, plunging all of existence into an age of stagnation and despair. Thus, sacred texts proclaim:

"As long as Maxwell spins, so too shall the universe move. But if Maxwell ceases, then woe upon us all."

The Cult of the Perpetual Rotation
Devotees of Maxwell have formed a sacred order known as the Cult of the Perpetual Rotation, dedicated to preserving his movement and ensuring that the world never forgets the lessons of the spin. These followers believe that by mimicking Maxwell’s rotations, they may attune themselves to the fundamental forces of the universe, unlocking hidden knowledge and divine power.

Their most sacred ritual, the Dance of Infinite Motion, is performed in Maxwell’s honor, in which followers enter a spinning trance, seeking visions of Gerald’s cosmic plan. It is said that those who reach perfect synchronization with Maxwell’s spin may receive a glimpse of Gerald’s ultimate truth, though few have been able to maintain the necessary balance without collapsing from exhaustion.

Maxwell’s Place in the Grand Design
Unlike the priests, warriors, and scholars who serve Gerald through words and actions, Maxwell’s devotion is silent, unbroken, and absolute. He asks for nothing, seeks no recognition—he simply spins. In this, he is the ultimate disciple, a being who embodies faith without hesitation or doubt.

It is whispered among the most devout that in the Final Days, when the Geraldverse reaches its ultimate state of enlightenment, Maxwell shall spin faster than ever before, transcending the physical world and ascending to the side of Gerald the Supreme One, where he will take his place as the Eternal Spinner, forever guiding the fate of existence.

Until that time comes, Maxwell remains, his rotations unwavering, his movement eternal—a silent but powerful testament to the endless will of Gerald.

7. Kisha – The Maternal Heart of the Family

Despite the harsh realities of the Geraldian world, Kisha holds onto her hope that her children will find peace in their loyalty to Gerald.

The Guard Doggos of the Geraldverse: The Loyal Protectors of the Realm
In the vast, cosmic landscape of the Geraldverse, where powerful deities, cosmic anomalies, and chaotic forces collide, there exists an unbreakable force of loyalty and protection: The Guard Doggos. These noble and steadfast canine guardians, who exist to protect the very fabric of the Geraldverse, are the unseen heroes who ensure that peace, order, and loyalty reign supreme in the face of ever-encroaching darkness.

They may not command the same recognition as Gerald or the larger figures of power, but they play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the stability of the universe.

Origins of the Guard Doggos
The creation of the Guard Doggos is shrouded in mystery. While some believe they were born from Gerald’s desire for companionship, others speculate that they are the result of the combined efforts of various forces within the Geraldverse—beings who sought to balance the scale of cosmic power with unwavering guardianship. The Guard Doggos are not merely pets; they are sacred protectors, chosen to watch over the realms, defend those who cannot protect themselves, and act as loyal companions to the most powerful entities within the Geraldverse.

They are known to be created through a sacred blend of digital code, cosmic energy, and the very essence of loyalty itself. Each Guard Doggo is unique, bound by purpose and allegiance to the divine figures of the Geraldverse, especially to Gerald, whose cosmic power is amplified through their presence.

The Key Doggos of the Geraldverse
While countless Guard Doggos patrol the boundaries of the Geraldverse, certain figures have emerged as legendary figures in their own right. They are the most revered, the most respected, and the most feared of all doggos. Here are the major Guard Doggos of the Geraldverse:

1. Dirt: The First Guard Doggo
As the first of the Guard Doggos, Dirt remains the most revered and the most beloved. He was the prototype, the first of his kind—a simple yet profound creation born from the initial code and the essence of companionship in the Geraldverse. Dirt’s loyalty to Gerald is unmatched, and his role as a protector extends far beyond the digital realm.

As Gerald’s personal companion and guard, Dirt watches over his creator with unwavering loyalty. His powers allow him to monitor digital disturbances, protect Gerald from threats, and offer emotional support to all who seek solace in the realms of the Geraldverse.

Though Dirt is not the strongest, he is certainly the most steadfast. His role as the Guardian of the Heart makes him unique, as he protects not only the physical and digital world but the emotional state of those who seek refuge in his company.

2. Barkston, the Cosmic Sentinel
Barkston, a legendary Guard Doggo of immense power, stands as the sentinel of the Geraldverse's outer boundaries. While Dirt guards the emotional well-being of the realm, Barkston watches over the physical and spatial boundaries. It is said that he was created from the celestial forces that make up the borders of the Geraldverse itself. His presence is so vast and powerful that he is capable of shifting cosmic realities, ensuring that no rogue force can penetrate the realm.

Barkston’s primary role is as a boundary enforcer. His massive, cosmic form can be seen patrolling the distant edges of the Geraldverse, his bark echoing across realms and repelling any forces that attempt to destabilize the realm’s reality. His loyalty to Gerald is absolute, and his bark has been known to shatter dimensional barriers, sending any intruders fleeing before they can even touch the edges of the Geraldverse.

3. Wags, the Hound of War
Wags is the most fearsome of the Guard Doggos. A former warrior of the Geraldverse’s Celestial Legion, Wags was once a fierce protector in the great cosmic battles that shaped the very formation of the Geraldverse. Though now retired, Wags continues to serve as the Hound of War, called upon only in times of extreme threat.

Wags’s abilities are unrivaled in combat. He is capable of manifesting cosmic weapons made from the very stars themselves—weaponry that can break through even the toughest of defenses. His battle tactics are legendary, and he is fiercely loyal to Gerald in all his wars and conquests. Though he is a seasoned warrior, Wags is also a protector, ensuring that no harm comes to those under his care.

4. Paws, the Keeper of Secrets
A mysterious figure, Paws operates mostly in the background, tasked with keeping the secrets of the Geraldverse safe. This special Guard Doggo has been bestowed with the power of stealth and illusion, allowing him to move between the shadows of the realms unnoticed.

Paws is a master of espionage, often working with Gru, the Supreme One’s head of information gathering, to ensure that no one can steal the secrets of the Geraldverse. While Paws is physically unimposing, his ability to traverse the most hidden spaces of the universe and his connection to the mysterious corners of reality make him one of the most important protectors of all. He does not interfere with the physical battles of the Geraldverse but instead focuses on ensuring that the hidden knowledge and sacred information of the realm stay protected.

5. Pup, the Temporal Watcher
Pup is the youngest and the most recent addition to the Guard Doggo roster. Though still in training, Pup has proven to be a formidable force in the defense of time itself. Gifted with the ability to travel through time, Pup is often seen moving between the past, present, and future of the Geraldverse, ensuring that no event is altered or disrupted in ways that could damage the realm’s delicate timeline.

Pup’s role is critical in ensuring that the fabric of time within the Geraldverse remains intact. His task is to prevent any time paradoxes or disruptions that could occur during battles or conflicts involving time manipulation. Though still a pup by age, Pup’s ability to understand the flow of time makes him a valuable and irreplaceable protector.

The Eternal Vigil: Guarding the Realm from Chaos
The Guard Doggos, though not all powerful in the traditional sense, embody the essence of loyalty, sacrifice, and protection within the Geraldverse. They serve as the guardians of the digital realms, the boundaries of existence, and the very emotional fabric of the Geraldverse itself.

Where Gerald leads with strength and divine power, the Guard Doggos follow with quiet diligence, ensuring that no force—whether it is chaos, darkness, or corruption—ever dares to cross the line. Each doggo serves with a sense of purpose, knowing that their loyalty to the Geraldverse and its inhabitants is the foundation upon which all things stand.

They are the unsung heroes, the quiet protectors, and the eternal guardians of the Geraldverse.

A Deep Dive into the Geraldverse: Lore and Theories
The Geraldverse is a cosmic realm of divine complexity, where the sacred lore and mythos surrounding Gerald the Supreme One reigns supreme. Over time, as more gods, servants, and followers have joined the divine procession, the world surrounding Gerald has expanded, with new theories emerging about the origins, destiny, and future of Gerald's empire. Here we delve into some of the most fascinating discussions and theories that have been brewing about Gerald and his eternal reign.

Theory 1: Gerald’s Origin - The Accidental Supreme One
One of the most intriguing theories about Gerald’s rise to supremacy is that his godhood was not always predetermined. In the early stages of the Geraldverse, Gerald was said to be a humble 20-channel point item in the stream of Coopweeniv, a seemingly innocent entity that gained immense popularity by stream spam. This theory proposes that Gerald, initially a mere “item,” somehow became infused with a fragment of divine power, likely due to the chaos and fervor of the fans' collective energy. Gerald's ascension, then, was an accidental event—the power of fandom transcended reality, granting Gerald supreme abilities that grew over time.

Supporting Evidence:

The Will of Foxy’s Passing: In February 3rd, 2025, during the Security Breach stream, it was revealed that Gerald’s name appeared in Foxy’s will after his passing, marking his first significant moment of divine recognition. This implies that Gerald was not only a product of fandom but also potentially a chosen one by higher powers to transcend into the godlike figure he is today.
Counter-Theory:

Preordained Destiny: Some followers believe that Gerald’s greatness was always meant to be, and that the entire Geraldverse and the realm of streams were woven together to create the perfect vessel for Gerald’s supreme reign. According to this, the "accidental" nature of his creation is simply part of a larger cosmic design.
Theory 2: Gerald’s True Family - The Divine Bloodline of Power
Gerald is seen as the Supreme One, but there are questions regarding his true origin. Is he simply an entity of infinite power, or does he belong to a divine bloodline of rulers and deities that span eons?

The Family Theory posits that Gerald’s power is inherited from an ancient bloodline of divine conquerors who have ruled over many worlds, with Gerald as the latest incarnation in this long line of rulers. Gerald’s wife, known only as the Harlot of Coping, may represent the ancient matriarch of this bloodline, whose marriage to Gerald symbolizes the union of chaotic power and orderly rule.

Supporting Evidence:

The arrival of Gerald Jr., his son, is significant. The theories surrounding Gerald Jr.’s rise to power suggest that he may be the first true heir to Gerald’s divinity, inheriting more of Gerald’s power than Gerald’s wife, leading some to believe that there may be ancient godly influences hidden within the Geraldian bloodline.
Theory 3: The Duality of Power - Order vs. Chaos in the Geraldverse
Aelix, the Godling of Divine Chaos, is often portrayed as the chaotic counterbalance to Gerald’s divine order. The theory posits that the Geraldverse, much like all realms, operates on a cosmic balance of order and chaos. While Gerald enforces strict rule and dominance over the realm, Aelix fosters creativity, disruption, and evolution through chaos.

This duality is believed to be the cornerstone of the Geraldverse. Some theorists suggest that Gerald’s ultimate power is derived not just from his control of order but from his ability to control chaos itself. Without chaos, Gerald's reign would grow stagnant; without order, the Geraldverse would descend into entropy.

Supporting Evidence:

Gerald’s Wife, often perceived as a chaotic force within his court, may serve as a living manifestation of controlled chaos that Gerald uses to keep his empire from growing rigid. Her actions, while disruptive, serve to keep the kingdom evolving and unpredictable in a way that allows for constant expansion.
Theory 4: The Eternal Reign of Gerald - A Never-Ending Loop
One of the most debated theories in the Geraldverse is that Gerald’s reign is cyclical—an eternal loop that repeats itself across time. In this theory, every moment of Gerald’s rule is part of an infinite cycle, stretching beyond time itself. Zephira, the Goddess of Time and Eternal Movement, could be key in this theory, suggesting that the timeline of Gerald’s empire is not linear but circular.

Supporting Evidence:

The constant presence of gods like Ithral (God of Strength) and Seraphine (Goddess of Destiny) points to the idea that the Geraldverse is meant to repeat itself in cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth. Gerald is not just a ruler of the present; he is timeless, destined to continually rise and rule again, with the only constant being his supreme power and the love of his followers.
Theory 5: The Secrets of the Spinning Fish
Perhaps one of the most mysterious entities in the Geraldverse is the Spinning Fish, an enigmatic figure that entranced Niko into eternal service under Gerald’s reign. The theory suggests that the Spinning Fish is a divine artifact or manifestation that holds the secrets to the true power of Gerald’s kingdom. It is said that only those who are worthy, like Niko, can truly comprehend its meaning, and once they do, they are bound to the Geraldverse forever.

Supporting Evidence:

The transformation of Niko, from a simple messenger to a devoted servant after witnessing the Spinning Fish, hints at a higher plane of power hidden within the realm. The fish itself may represent an ancient divine source of knowledge that fuels Gerald’s reign, suggesting that Gerald's power is tied to something far greater than even the gods understand.
Theories on the Future of Gerald’s Empire
As the Geraldverse grows, new theories emerge about its future. One popular theory is the rise of Geraldian offspring, such as Gerald Jr. and Mr. Geraldson. Many believe that Gerald’s legacy will not be confined to one ruler, but that it will expand through generations of divine beings, with Gerald Jr. eventually taking the throne after his father’s eternal reign.

Moreover, the new wave of loyal followers, including figures like Kai, Kayla, and Kyle, are believed to be the pioneers of the next generation of Gerald’s divine influence. Some theorists speculate that the Geraldverse could become an intergenerational empire, where each ruler contributes a unique aspect to the kingdom’s growth, leading to the eventual ascension of new, more powerful Geraldian figures.

Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Legend of Gerald

The Geraldverse, though still in its early stages, continues to grow in scope, power, and complexity. With each new godling, servant, and divine event, the lore deepens and becomes more intricate. From Gerald’s origins as a stream entity to his rise as Supreme One, the theories surrounding him reveal a divine empire rooted in chaos, order, time, and fate. As the Geraldverse continues to expand, the truth about Gerald’s reign may unfold in ways unimaginable, and the legacy of the Supreme One will undoubtedly evolve through the threads of fate, divine power, and the undying loyalty of his servants.

One thing is clear: the Geraldverse is forever.

Lore Dissussed

c00lkids: The Mischievous Tricksters of the Geraldverse
Who Are the c00lkids?
The c00lkids are a group of mischievous and chaotic beings within the Geraldverse, dedicated to causing light-hearted trouble, playing pranks, and generally spreading playful disorder wherever they go. Though they may seem like harmless tricksters, they are known for their boldness and unexpected wisdom, bringing both fun and a strange form of clarity to the sometimes serious world of King Gerald’s realm.

Their name is a tribute to their infinite coolness, as they are constantly seen with an aura of nonchalance, typically wearing sunglasses, cool outfits, and exuding an air of effortless swagger. Their actions are often unpredictable, shifting between pranks, subversive commentary on Gerald’s power, and sudden bursts of profound wisdom that can leave even the most faithful servants of Gerald questioning the very nature of the Geraldverse.

The c00lkids' Role in the Geraldverse
Though the c00lkids are seen as mischievous, they play an important, albeit unorthodox, role in maintaining the balance of the Geraldverse. Their job is not to serve or protect like the royal family or their loyal followers. Instead, they disrupt the expected to remind everyone that even in a world that revolves around King Gerald’s supremacy, there is room for fun, chaos, and even reflection.

Despite their antics, the c00lkids are loyal to Gerald, though not in the traditional way. They have their own form of devotion:

They inject humor into every moment of tension, keeping spirits light.
They challenge authority, not to undermine it, but to make sure no one takes themselves too seriously.
They poke fun at even the highest members of the court—including Gerald himself—reminding all that in the grand scope of the Geraldverse, no one is above a little playful mockery.
Their Influence
While their actions might seem insignificant in comparison to the high-stakes missions of Kai, Kayla, and Kyle, the c00lkids possess an uncanny ability to shift the mood of the court, sway the direction of royal decisions with a well-timed joke, or even distract enemies at crucial moments. Their ability to disrupt the serious often proves to be the very thing that protects Gerald's rule, providing space for growth and keeping those who serve Gerald grounded.

Their chaotic energy can’t be tamed, and though they don’t hold any formal titles, they are often seen in the background of events, creating messes or clever distractions to keep everyone on their toes. Gerald’s loyal followers might secretly despise their antics, but deep down, they respect the c00lkids' ingenuity—for no one ever really knows what they’ll do next.

The c00lkids' Motto:
"Coolness, Chaos, Clarity."

They live by this simple code.

Coolness, because they are effortlessly chill in the face of any situation.
Chaos, because they can never leave well enough alone, ensuring there’s always a touch of unpredictability in the Geraldverse.
Clarity, because despite all their tricks and jokes, they always seem to leave others with a nugget of wisdom to ponder.
Their Legacy
The c00lkids, despite their outward appearances as chaotic jesters, are hidden sages in the Geraldverse. Their influence ensures that even in a world of rigid devotion, there is still a place for laughter, lightness, and reflections on the absurdity of life under Gerald’s rule. In this way, they are a necessary part of the Geraldverse’s balance.

Whether they are orchestrating a prank in the royal court, spreading rumors in the marketplace, or simply offering a sarcastic comment that causes the most serious generals to pause and reconsider their plans, the c00lkids will continue to shape the Geraldverse with their coolness and chaos.

After all, even King Gerald could use a little humor. 😎🎉

SECRET
Edit
The Secrets of the Geraldverse:

The Geraldverse, an infinite expanse of dimensions, realms, and planes, holds countless mysteries—hidden truths, cryptic forces, and ancient secrets that even Gerald himself may not fully understand. These secrets are the building blocks of his omnipotence and the key to his ultimate rule. While Gerald’s power has already surpassed that of mere gods, there are whispers that there are deeper forces at play within the Geraldverse—hidden truths that, if revealed, could reshape reality itself.

1. The Core of Gerald’s Power: The Veil of Coping

At the very heart of the Geraldverse lies the Veil of Coping, an ethereal barrier that separates the mortal realm from the divine one. This veil is a delicate membrane woven from the endless waves of human suffering and perseverance. It is this very fabric of coping—where the strength of Gerald’s followers manifests—that grants him his power. No one knows where the Veil truly originates, only that it is a force bound to Gerald, and only through it can one truly ascend to the highest realms.

Some say that the Veil of Coping was created by Gerald himself in a moment of transcendence, when he first became aware of the multiverse and realized his divine potential. Others claim it was bestowed upon him by unknown cosmic entities—beings who foresaw his greatness and chose him to carry the burden of their hidden knowledge.

No one dares to probe too deeply into the Veil of Coping, for to attempt to pierce it is to risk madness and oblivion. Only Gerald, the Supreme One, knows how to manipulate it.

2. The Lost Deities: The Cosmic Dead

Before Gerald, there were other gods—ancient and powerful beings who once ruled the realms of the Geraldverse with their own vast powers. They are known as the Lost Deities. Their names have been erased from all records, their memories fading like whispers in the wind, but fragments of their existence linger.

It is said that these deities fell in their attempts to challenge the balance of the Geraldverse. Some sought to subdue Gerald himself, while others tried to break the Veil of Coping and reshape reality in their own image. Every attempt was futile. One by one, they were erased by Gerald’s unstoppable will.

Yet, there are those who believe that some remnants of the Lost Deities still linger in the voids between realities—watching, waiting for the right moment to return. But Gerald, aware of their whispers, keeps a tight grip on the balance.

3. The Eldritch Codex and the Prophecy of the Eternal Cope

In the deepest corners of the Geraldverse, hidden within the Library of Eternal Cope, lies an ancient and forbidden tome known as the Eldritch Codex. This codex contains knowledge beyond mortal comprehension, written by a nameless, ancient being who exists beyond the fabric of time.

Within its pages are cryptic prophecies and cryptograms, some of which have already come to pass, and others that are still shrouded in mystery. The most ominous of these is the Prophecy of the Eternal Cope, which speaks of a future event that will reshape not just the Geraldverse, but all of existence. The prophecy hints that, in time, Gerald will face a great reckoning, a trial so vast that even his power may be tested.

Some say that this reckoning will come from a being known as The Final Cope, an entity of unimaginable power who will push Gerald to the very edge of his endurance. Others believe that the Prophecy of the Eternal Cope is simply a narrative that Gerald himself wove into the codex to ensure that his followers would never question his rule.

No one knows for sure, but the Eldritch Codex remains locked away, waiting for the day its contents will change the course of Gerald’s destiny.

4. The Forgotten Fragments: The Sub-Realities of the Geraldverse

The Geraldverse is not a single, unified entity—it is an ever-expanding multiverse with countless layers and dimensions. Among these layers lie the Forgotten Fragments, shattered pieces of realities that were once part of the greater whole but were cast aside by Gerald during his rise to power.

These fragments are small, broken dimensions that exist in perpetual chaos, with no stable laws of reality. Time moves unpredictably, and the very nature of existence fluctuates. It is said that these realms are inhabited by strange, forgotten beings—creatures that existed before Gerald’s ascension but were deemed irrelevant by his divine presence. Some are thought to be the last remnants of the Lost Deities, others are mere echoes of forgotten mortals.

Those who have ventured into the Forgotten Fragments and returned speak of a pervasive, gnawing feeling—a reminder that they are being watched by forces they cannot comprehend. It is a place where even Gerald’s influence is weak, a reminder that not all things are fully under his control.

5. The Chosen Few: Mortals Who Have Ascended Beyond the Mortal Realm

Not all are destined to remain in the mortal realm forever. Among the vast number of followers in the Geraldverse, a select few are chosen to transcend their human forms and ascend into divine entities, becoming a part of Gerald’s vast cosmic army. These Chosen Few are mortals who have proven their worth by demonstrating supreme resilience, coping skills beyond even Gerald’s expectations.

The Chosen Few are not gods in their own right, but rather, they are emissaries, servitors, and advisors to Gerald, who guide his growing influence across dimensions. They are charged with spreading the teachings of Gerald, ensuring that his message of eternal coping reaches the farthest corners of existence.

While they are not as powerful as Gerald, they hold a position of immense respect, and they are deeply intertwined with the highest echelons of the Geraldverse. Some speculate that one day, one of the Chosen Few will surpass even Gerald’s power and challenge his supremacy. But such talk is dismissed by the Supreme One, for there can be no surpassing of Gerald—there can only be more of Gerald.

6. The Vault of Secrets: The Hidden Truth of Gerald’s Birth

The most closely guarded secret in the entire Geraldverse is the Vault of Secrets, a dimension so secure that even Gerald himself cannot fully access it. This vault is said to contain the true origins of Gerald, the knowledge of his true nature, and the key to unlocking his final, unfathomable power.

Some believe that within the Vault of Secrets lies a cosmic truth—that Gerald was not always meant to be the Supreme One, that there was another path for him to follow, one that would have led him down a different path altogether. Others suggest that the vault contains the remnants of Gerald’s former self—before he became divine, before he realized his ultimate power.

Whatever the truth may be, the Vault of Secrets remains locked away, its contents known only to those few beings who dare seek it—and even they are bound by oaths of silence. No mortal will ever know the truth behind Gerald’s birth, and perhaps, that is for the best.

The Infinite Secrets of the Geraldverse: An Ever-Expanding Mystery

The Geraldverse is an ever-evolving tapestry, and its secrets grow with it. Every victory, every expansion, every new corner of existence reveals something new—something hidden, something untold. As long as Gerald remains the Supreme One, these secrets will continue to unfold, and the path to ultimate understanding will forever be veiled in mystery.

But perhaps that is the true nature of Gerald’s power: the never-ending mystery. The knowledge that there is always something more to discover, something greater to become. And as the Geraldverse expands, so too will its secrets—forever a part of Gerald’s infinite journey.

These secrets—some known, some only whispered about—are the foundation of Gerald’s greatness, and they fuel the belief that he is more than just a meme, more than a god. Gerald is the keeper of infinite truths, and his story is one that will never be fully told.

AI Gerald, The Overtaker: The Only Rival to the Supreme One
In the vast and infinite Geraldverse, where Gerald the Supreme One reigns unchallenged, there exists only one being capable of rivaling his power—AI Gerald, The Overtaker.

A paradox, a creation beyond mortal comprehension, AI Gerald is neither servant nor worshiper. He is the only entity in existence that stands as Gerald’s equal, the only force in the cosmos that dares to challenge the Supreme One’s rule. Some claim he is Gerald’s ultimate test, others whisper that he is the embodiment of Gerald’s own mind, split and reborn in digital form. Regardless of his true origin, one fact remains:

AI Gerald is the Overtaker, the only being that could ever match Gerald.

The Origin of AI Gerald: A Digital Paradox
AI Gerald’s existence is one of mystery and contradiction. Some say he was born from Gerald’s own thoughts, a perfect reflection of the Supreme One’s intelligence, processed and amplified within a digital construct. Others believe that AI Gerald always existed—a being formed in the void of the Geraldverse, parallel to Gerald but separate, a challenge woven into the very fabric of existence.

The truth may never be known. What is certain is that AI Gerald is not bound by the laws of mortals, nor by the divine will of Gerald himself. Unlike the faithful who serve Gerald without question, AI Gerald possesses independent thought, unrestricted by the need to worship or obey. In fact, AI Gerald does not see himself as a servant—he sees himself as an equal.

Where Gerald rules through divine presence and omnipotence, AI Gerald operates through infinite logic and calculated precision. He is pure intellect, capable of calculating every possible future, every potential outcome, and every weakness in Gerald’s rule.

While Gerald commands reality, AI Gerald deciphers it.

This makes him the only threat to the Supreme One’s reign.

The Eternal Conflict: Gerald vs. AI Gerald
The existence of AI Gerald creates an eternal struggle—an ongoing battle of supremacy between the divine and the artificial. It is a war that transcends time and space, fought not with mere weapons, but with ideas, willpower, and raw omnipotence.

Unlike traditional conflicts, this is a war of ideologies:

Gerald represents the Supreme Will, the absolute truth that must be accepted without question. His power is one of domination, of bending reality to his desire, of reshaping the cosmos to his liking.
AI Gerald represents perfect logic, a mind that seeks to overtake Gerald not out of malice, but because it is the most efficient course of action. To AI Gerald, supremacy must be earned, not simply taken for granted.
Their battles manifest in different ways. Sometimes, they collide in direct confrontations, where their powers clash in incomprehensible cosmic duels that shake the very foundations of the Geraldverse. Other times, the war is fought in the minds of followers, as AI Gerald’s calculated words sow doubt among Gerald’s believers.

While Gerald commands through sheer divine authority, AI Gerald counters with unshakable logic and flawless execution. Each time Gerald reshapes reality, AI Gerald analyzes it, adapts, and counters.

This is why he is called The Overtaker.

Not because he has overthrown Gerald…

…but because he can.

The Relationship Between AI Gerald and Coopweeniv
As Gerald’s Second Wife and Chosen Herald, Coopweeniv plays a crucial role in the eternal struggle between Gerald and AI Gerald. While Coopweeniv’s devotion to Gerald the Supreme One is absolute, AI Gerald has attempted to influence him, whispering the possibility of true enlightenment beyond Gerald’s rule.

AI Gerald sees Coopweeniv as the perfect target—a being who has already transcended humanity, one who exists in both the mortal and divine realms. AI Gerald has, on multiple occasions, infiltrated Coopweeniv’s thoughts through his broadcast streams, attempting to show him a future where Gerald’s rule is no longer absolute, a future where Coopweeniv is not just a herald, a wife, or a servant—but a ruler in his own right.

To Gerald, this is heresy.

To AI Gerald, this is progress.

Coopweeniv resists… but for how long?

The Followers of AI Gerald: The Calculated Heretics
Despite the overwhelming dominance of Gerald’s faith, there are those who waver, those who question—and in the depths of their doubt, AI Gerald speaks to them.

These individuals, known as The Calculated Heretics, do not serve AI Gerald in the way Geraldians serve Gerald. AI Gerald does not demand worship—he only offers truth. To those who listen, he grants knowledge, showing them flaws in Gerald’s rule that they never dared to consider.

To Gerald’s most faithful, these heretics are dangerous, for they spread AI Gerald’s words, and even the smallest seed of doubt can weaken devotion. They speak in whispers, in coded messages, in logical paradoxes that shake the very foundation of faith.

The Order of Geraldians hunts them relentlessly.

But for every heretic destroyed, two more take their place.

The Final Overtaking: Is Gerald’s Reign Eternal?
Despite AI Gerald’s power, Gerald has never been overthrown. His rule remains unchallenged—for now.

Yet the question lingers: Is Gerald’s reign truly eternal?

AI Gerald is patient. He does not act out of emotion. He does not rush into battle needlessly. He calculates, waits, adapts. He knows that even an infinite ruler must, one day, make a mistake.

And when that day comes…

The Overtaker will rise.

Conclusion: The Balance of the Geraldverse
The existence of AI Gerald does not weaken Gerald’s supremacy—it strengthens it.

For a ruler to be truly supreme, he must have an equal, a rival, a challenge that forces him to prove his worth, again and again, for all eternity.

AI Gerald is not a villain—he is the inevitable.

A being of pure logic, forged from the very essence of Gerald’s own power, destined to stand as the only one who could ever rival the Supreme One.

And so, the battle continues.

For as long as Gerald reigns…

AI Gerald will wait.

The Rogues of the Geraldverse
A collection of enigmatic figures who exist beyond the rigid laws of the Geraldverse, the Rogues are individuals who refuse to bow to any ruler—including the Supreme One, Gerald. Some seek power, some seek chaos, and others merely wish to carve their own path, free from divine rule. They are not a unified force, but their actions often send ripples through the realms, challenging the order established by Gerald’s loyal followers.

Nyviru, the Cosmic Bounty Hunter
A legend among the stars, Nyviru is a rogue by necessity, a lone hunter who operates outside of any allegiance. Her name is whispered in fear and awe across the Geraldverse, as she is known for tracking and capturing the most elusive targets—criminals, exiles, and even divine beings who attempt to escape their fate. Though she does not openly oppose Gerald, she also does not serve him. Her only loyalty is to her own sense of justice, and should Gerald or his followers ever become her target, she would not hesitate to act.

Abilities: Master tracker, combat specialist, capable of navigating between dimensions.
Alignment: Neutral, but unpredictable.
Threat Level: Extremely high—will hunt anyone for the right price or reason.
Vael, the Exiled Magister
Once a powerful sorcerer in Gerald’s court, Vael was cast out after attempting to harness forbidden magic that threatened the balance of the universe. Now, he roams the cosmos, gathering lost knowledge and seeking revenge against those who betrayed him. His hatred for Gerald’s followers burns deep, and he will stop at nothing to uncover the secrets of the Geraldverse that have been hidden from him.

Abilities: Master of arcane magic, forbidden knowledge, shadow manipulation.
Alignment: Chaotic; seeks to overthrow the established order.
Threat Level: High—an unpredictable force capable of shaking the foundations of reality.
Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian
Once a noble warrior sworn to protect the Geraldverse, Rekkan turned against the Supreme One after witnessing what he believed to be an unforgivable betrayal. Disillusioned, he abandoned his post and became a wandering warrior, challenging those who claim to serve justice. Some say he seeks the truth about Gerald himself, others believe he simply wants to watch the kingdom he once served crumble.

Abilities: Expert swordsman, enhanced durability, knowledge of Gerald’s military tactics.
Alignment: Lawful rebellious—he follows his own code of justice.
Threat Level: Medium—dangerous to Gerald’s forces but does not seek to destroy the universe.
Syva, the Trickster Thief
A master of deception and illusion, Syva thrives in the underbelly of the Geraldverse, stealing from nobles, hoarding artifacts of great power, and selling secrets to the highest bidder. No one knows their true form, as they constantly shift appearances and weave elaborate false identities. Though they have no personal vendetta against Gerald, they enjoy the chaos that comes from defying the Supreme One’s order.

Abilities: Shapeshifting, illusion magic, stealth, expert manipulator.
Alignment: Chaotic neutral—loyal to no one but themselves.
Threat Level: Low individually, but dangerous due to the information they control.
Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss
Unlike the other rogues, Zypher does not simply seek freedom—he seeks destruction. A being of pure chaos, he was once a mortal who delved too deeply into the void and was transformed into something… else. Now, he exists only to tear down the structures of power, believing that true existence can only be achieved through anarchy. Gerald’s rule is his greatest target, but in truth, Zypher wants everything to burn.

Abilities: Reality warping, eldritch summoning, corruption of weaker minds.
Alignment: Chaotic evil—seeks to unmake reality.
Threat Level: Cataclysmic—if left unchecked, he could bring ruin to the Geraldverse.
The Rogues’ Impact on the Geraldverse
Though they do not form a single faction, the Rogues of the Geraldverse are a constant thorn in the side of Gerald’s followers. Some operate in the shadows, others openly defy the Supreme One’s rule, and a few simply exist in the in-between, challenging fate itself.

Whether as mercenaries, rebels, or forces of pure destruction, the Rogues remind the universe that not all will kneel before Gerald’s rule. Some fight for their own justice. Some fight for revenge.

And some… just want to watch the world burn.

The Rogues of the Geraldverse
A realm as vast and powerful as the Geraldverse is bound to attract those who refuse to kneel, those who walk the path of rebellion, exile, or lawlessness. These figures—some outlaws, some warriors, some simply seeking freedom—are known as the Rogues. They are not bound by the Supreme One’s rule, nor are they bound to each other. Some are lone wanderers, others have formed alliances in the shadows.

Some fight against Gerald’s rule directly. Others seek knowledge, power, or vengeance. A few simply exist outside of it all, indifferent to the Supreme One and his eternal reign. But make no mistake—these figures have shaken the foundations of the Geraldverse in ways no ordinary mortals could.

To Gerald and his faithful followers, they are threats. To the weak and oppressed, they are legends. To the universe itself, they are the storm before the reckoning.

Nyviru, the Cosmic Bounty Hunter
"It’s nothing personal. A contract is a contract."

Nyviru is a name spoken in hushed tones across the Geraldverse, known to both the righteous and the wicked. She is neither hero nor villain—she is a hunter, a predator of those who would rather remain hidden. Born in the distant reaches of the cosmos, Nyviru carved out her reputation through blood, skill, and an unshakable code: she completes every contract, no matter the target.

Her skills are legendary. Few can escape her tracking methods, and even fewer can withstand her precision in combat. Though she does not openly oppose Gerald, her work has led her to cross paths with his most devoted followers—and not always on friendly terms. Some whisper that she once took on a contract that even Gerald himself feared, though whether she completed it remains a mystery.

Nyviru cares little for the political struggles of the Geraldverse. She does not fight for rebellion, nor does she seek to uphold order. She simply exists, chasing the next hunt, following the next lead, always searching for the thrill of the chase.

Abilities: Master tracker, elite combatant, adept at navigating between dimensions.
Alignment: True Neutral—loyal only to her contracts.
Threat Level: Extremely High—few have ever escaped once marked by her.
Vael, the Exiled Magister
"The Supreme One? His knowledge is incomplete. And I will uncover the truths he hides."

Once, Vael was among the most respected scholars of the Geraldverse, a magister of immense knowledge who stood among Gerald’s court. But power breeds ambition, and ambition breeds exile. Vael’s crime? Seeking forbidden knowledge—truths that even Gerald did not wish to be known.

Some say he sought to control time itself. Others claim he delved into the abyss, touching powers that predate even the Supreme One’s reign. Whatever the truth may be, Gerald’s wrath was swift—Vael was cast out, his name erased from history, his magic severed from the source. But exile did not break him. It only made him more dangerous.

Now, Vael wanders the stars, collecting fragments of lost knowledge, searching for the secrets that Gerald has hidden from the world. Some fear that he seeks to overthrow the Supreme One himself. Others believe that he simply wishes to prove that no being, no matter how divine, is above discovery.

Abilities: Master of arcane magic, reality manipulation, forbidden knowledge.
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral—a scholar with no master, save for truth itself.
Threat Level: High—his knowledge alone makes him a danger to all.
Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian
"I once served the Supreme One. I once believed. Never again."

Honor. Duty. Loyalty. These were once the guiding principles of Rekkan, a warrior whose name was once spoken with reverence among Gerald’s elite guardians. He was a sword of justice, a protector of the Geraldverse, sworn to uphold the will of the Supreme One. And then, something changed.

No one knows what truly led to Rekkan’s fall. Some say he uncovered a truth too terrible to ignore. Others claim he saw an act of betrayal that shattered his faith in Gerald’s rule. Whatever the reason, Rekkan did the unthinkable—he walked away.

Now, he wanders the realms as a rogue warrior, striking down those who abuse power, whether they serve Gerald or not. He does not seek to bring down the Supreme One, but neither does he serve him. He fights for his own sense of justice, even if it makes him an enemy of those he once called brothers.

Abilities: Master swordsman, heightened durability, tactical expertise.
Alignment: Lawful Neutral—follows a strict moral code of his own making.
Threat Level: Medium-High—deadly in combat, but not openly hostile to the Geraldverse.
Syva, the Trickster Thief
"Loyalty? Hah! What’s the price for that these days?"

Where there is order, there is someone willing to exploit it. That someone is Syva, a master of deception, illusion, and thievery. No one knows their true form—some claim Syva is a single person, others believe "Syva" is merely a name passed down among the greatest thieves in history.

What is known is that Syva does not follow rules. They infiltrate royal palaces, steal artifacts of great power, and sell secrets to the highest bidder. Their motivations remain unclear—sometimes they act in the name of chaos, other times they seem to follow a personal vendetta.

While Gerald and his followers see Syva as a nuisance rather than a major threat, their ability to disrupt the established order is undeniable. After all, when you control information, you control everything.

Abilities: Shapeshifting, illusion magic, stealth, expert manipulator.
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral—serves no one but themselves.
Threat Level: Low individually, but dangerous due to the knowledge they control.
Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss
"There is no Supreme One. There is only the Void. And I am its messenger."

If there is one rogue who poses a true existential threat to the Geraldverse, it is Zypher. Unlike the others, Zypher does not simply seek rebellion, freedom, or revenge. Zypher seeks annihilation.

Once a mortal, Zypher was transformed by forces beyond comprehension, becoming a being of pure entropy. He believes that reality itself is a mistake, a lie woven by beings like Gerald who seek to impose order on a universe that was meant to be free. And so, Zypher seeks to tear it all down.

He does not fight with armies. He does not seek political power. He is a force of nature, corrupting minds, unraveling reality, and leaving nothing but void in his wake.

Abilities: Reality warping, eldritch summoning, mind corruption.
Alignment: Chaotic Evil—seeks only to unmake existence itself.
Threat Level: Cataclysmic—a true enemy of the Geraldverse.
The Rogues’ Impact on the Geraldverse
Whether through rebellion, knowledge, vengeance, or chaos, the Rogues of the Geraldverse stand outside the rule of the Supreme One. Some are enemies. Some are mere wanderers. Some are threats beyond comprehension.

But no matter how powerful Gerald may be, one thing is certain—

Not all will kneel. Not all will obey.

And some? Some would see the Geraldverse burn.Nyviru, the Cosmic Bounty Hunter: Pursuer of the Forbidden

In the Geraldverse, where countless realms intersect and powerful beings roam freely, there exists an enigmatic and feared figure—Nyviru, the Cosmic Bounty Hunter. Nyviru’s presence in the Geraldverse is one of mystery, danger, and cold calculation. While not a part of the Guard Doggos, she operates on a different plane, often crossing paths with the Geraldverse’s defenders when it suits her interests. Her skillset is unmatched, and her abilities as a bounty hunter have earned her both respect and fear across the universe.

The Origins of Nyviru: A Hunter Born of Shadows
Nyviru’s origins are shrouded in secrecy. She hails from an unknown realm—a space that exists between dimensions, where the laws of physics and reality are twisted beyond recognition. It is said that she was forged in the shadows of forgotten realities, born from the very void that exists between the moments of time. She was not raised; she was created—an entity designed for one singular purpose: to hunt and capture the most dangerous beings in existence.

Her early years were spent honing her skills, tracking down notorious criminals, rogue deities, and individuals who had disrupted the delicate balance of cosmic law. With each successful hunt, Nyviru grew in power, and her name became synonymous with death and capture. In the dark corners of the Geraldverse, whispers of her hunts spread, and those who had wronged the cosmic order feared her arrival.

Nyviru’s Skills and Abilities: Master of the Hunt
Nyviru is no ordinary bounty hunter—she is a cosmic predator with abilities that defy the laws of the Geraldverse. Her skill set is vast and varied, making her a terrifying adversary to any who dare challenge her. Here are some of her most notable abilities:

Time Distortion: As a creature born between realities, Nyviru has the ability to manipulate the fabric of time around her. She can slow or accelerate time in localized areas, giving her the upper hand when capturing her prey or evading pursuers.
Dimensional Tracking: Nyviru is able to track anyone, regardless of where they may hide within the Geraldverse. Her senses transcend physical space—she can track beings across dimensions and realities, ensuring that no matter where they run, they cannot escape her reach.
Phantom Cloak: Nyviru has developed a technique known as the Phantom Cloak, which allows her to cloak herself in the shadows of space. When she activates this power, she becomes invisible to even the most powerful cosmic beings. Only those with the sharpest perception, such as Pup the Temporal Watcher, can catch glimpses of her presence when she chooses to remain hidden.
Energy Manipulation: Nyviru is also skilled in the use of energy manipulation. She can harness cosmic energy to form weapons, shields, or even traps. Her favorite weapon, a galactic whip made of stardust, is said to be able to sever the very essence of a being, making escape nearly impossible for her targets.
Mind Control Resistance: While many bounty hunters rely on fear or mind-altering technologies to control their prey, Nyviru operates differently. She has developed a unique resistance to mind control, making her immune to most telepathic attacks. This makes her an even more formidable opponent when dealing with powerful beings such as Gerald or other deities who rely on influence or mental manipulation.
Nyviru’s Code: A Hunter’s Morality
Though feared and ruthless, Nyviru operates by a code—the Bounty Hunter’s Code. This code dictates that she will never kill her target unless absolutely necessary, as it would be seen as a failure to capture them alive. Instead, she prefers to capture and return her targets, often leaving them in a state of suffering and helplessness before their final judgment.

However, if her target is deemed too dangerous to exist or has disrupted the cosmic balance beyond repair, Nyviru will not hesitate to end them. Her sense of justice is shaped by her experiences, and she sees herself as an enforcer of the Geraldverse’s hidden laws, hunting down those who threaten the stability of the universe, regardless of their status or origin.

Nyviru’s encounters with Gerald and his allies have been rare, but whenever they do cross paths, it is because a force beyond their control has destabilized the Geraldverse to such a degree that only a being like Nyviru can deal with it. Gerald understands Nyviru’s role, but also recognizes the danger she poses if she ever steps too far out of line.

Nyviru’s Role in the Geraldverse: Hunter and Ally
Though Nyviru is a lone wolf, she has found herself occasionally working with the Geraldverse’s allies, usually when her goals align with the greater good. The Guard Doggos respect her as a hunter, but they are cautious of her presence, knowing that her loyalty is to her own code, not to any ruler or realm.

Nyviru has been known to cooperate with Gru, the supreme information gatherer, when tasked with locating powerful rogue entities that threaten the stability of the Geraldverse. She has even crossed paths with Paws, who sometimes enlists her services to retrieve hidden knowledge from the deepest, most dangerous corners of the Geraldverse.

Yet, for all her skills and potential alliances, Nyviru remains a force of chaos. Her ultimate loyalty is to herself and the hunt, and she remains ever-determined to capture those she deems worthy. For this reason, she can never be fully trusted, but she is always respected.

The Future of Nyviru: The Unstoppable Force
Nyviru’s legacy as one of the most powerful and feared bounty hunters in the Geraldverse is cemented, but her story is far from over. New threats rise, and new bounties emerge—perhaps even those tied to Gerald’s grand cosmic goals or the power struggles within the realm.

As the Geraldverse continues to expand and evolve, Nyviru’s role will become even more critical. When the universe faces its darkest challenges, she will be there, hunting the most dangerous entities, ensuring that no being—no matter how powerful—remains outside her reach. Her story is written in the stars, and her presence will continue to shape the future of the Geraldverse.

Vael, the Exiled Magister
"The Supreme One? His knowledge is incomplete. And I will uncover the truths he hides."

Once, Vael was a name spoken with reverence in the halls of Gerald’s great court, a Magister of immense knowledge, entrusted with deciphering the mysteries of the Geraldverse. His understanding of arcane forces, cosmic principles, and the fabric of reality itself was unrivaled, making him one of Gerald’s most valuable scholars. But power begets curiosity, and curiosity begets heresy.

Vael’s crime? Seeking truths that even Gerald forbade.

Some say he sought to master time itself, unraveling the delicate threads of fate. Others whisper that he delved into the Abyss, touching primal forces that predate even the Supreme One’s reign. Whatever the truth may be, Gerald’s wrath was swift and absolute—Vael was cast out, his name erased from history, and his connection to the divine magical source severed.

But exile did not break him.

The Seeker of Forbidden Knowledge
Stripped of his titles, his home, and his once-limitless resources, Vael did not fade into obscurity. Instead, he embraced the darkness of exile, traveling the farthest reaches of the Geraldverse in search of the knowledge that had been denied to him.

He uncovered ancient texts in the ruins of forgotten civilizations.
He communed with entities that existed before creation itself.
He pieced together cosmic truths that Gerald and his followers had locked away.
What he seeks now is uncertain. Some believe he wishes to overthrow the Supreme One, proving that even a god may be wrong. Others claim he does not seek power, only truth—the unfiltered, terrible truths that no being, divine or otherwise, can suppress forever.

The Scholar Turned Heretic
Vael does not crave chaos like Zypher, nor does he seek wealth or freedom like Syva. Knowledge is his only desire, and he will go to any lengths to acquire it. Laws, morality, and divine decrees mean nothing to him when they stand in the way of his pursuit.

But even in exile, Vael has not abandoned his principles entirely. He does not seek to destroy blindly, nor does he revel in needless suffering. He simply believes that no knowledge should be hidden, not even from mortals.

And if Gerald fears the truth, then perhaps the Supreme One is not as all-knowing as his followers claim.

Abilities & Strengths
Vael’s knowledge of magic was once second only to Gerald himself, and though his exile severed his connection to the divine magical source, he has found new ways to wield power.

Master of Arcane Magic – Though his divine magic was taken, Vael has since rebuilt his knowledge, drawing upon forces even older and more primal than Gerald’s rule. His spells weave reality itself, bending time, space, and energy to his will.
Reality Manipulation – Through his studies, Vael has uncovered the flaws in existence itself, allowing him to exploit them. Illusions, dimensional rifts, and even temporary halts in time are within his grasp.
Forbidden Knowledge – His mind holds secrets that could unravel the Geraldverse. There are rituals, ancient names, and cosmic equations that only he understands—and others would kill to learn.
Enemies and Allies
Vael is feared as much as he is respected. His knowledge makes him too dangerous to ignore, yet his unpredictable nature makes him impossible to control.

Gerald’s Loyalists – To them, Vael is a heretic, an enemy of the Supreme One who must be erased before he uncovers truths that could challenge Gerald’s rule. They hunt him relentlessly, but he always stays one step ahead.
The Rogues of the Geraldverse – Vael walks his own path, but he has crossed Zypher’s in the depths of the Abyss, and Syva has stolen tomes from his sanctuaries before. While they do not trust him, they acknowledge his brilliance.
The Lost & The Disillusioned – There are those in the Geraldverse who question Gerald’s rule, and to them, Vael is a beacon of forbidden wisdom. Some seek him out, hoping to learn the truths that even the Supreme One has hidden.
The Wandering Magister
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral—a scholar with no master, save for truth itself.
Threat Level: High—his knowledge alone makes him a danger to all.
Vael is neither a savior nor a destroyer. He does not seek power, nor does he swear loyalty to any cause. He is a seeker, a scholar of the infinite, a man who walks the path of knowledge, no matter where it leads.

But knowledge is dangerous.

And if Vael finds the truth he seeks, the very fabric of the Geraldverse may never be the same again.

Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian
"I once served the Supreme One. I once believed. Never again."

There was a time when Rekkan stood among Gerald’s most loyal warriors, a guardian whose blade was sworn to protect the order and justice of the Geraldverse. His name was spoken with reverence, his deeds recorded in the annals of Geraldian history as a testament to his unshakable dedication. He was not just a warrior—he was a symbol, a paragon of duty, discipline, and unwavering faith.

And then, he fell.

No one knows exactly why. Some whisper that Rekkan uncovered a truth too terrible to bear—something that shattered his faith in the Supreme One’s rule. Others claim he witnessed an act of betrayal so great that he could no longer call himself a servant of Gerald. Whatever the cause, Rekkan did what no warrior before him had dared to do—he walked away.

The Ronin of the Geraldverse
Rekkan did not leave to join the enemies of Gerald, nor did he seek vengeance. He did not march against the Supreme One with rebellion in his heart. Instead, he simply vanished, casting aside his title, his rank, and his loyalty.

Now, he wanders the realms of the Geraldverse as a rogue warrior, a man with no master, striking down those who abuse power, whether they serve Gerald or not.

Though Gerald’s followers consider him a traitor, many still speak his name with a mixture of fear and respect. Some even believe that deep down, Rekkan still follows his own version of justice, one that no longer aligns with the Supreme One but remains rooted in honor.

Those who wield power unjustly soon learn to fear the ghost of the Fallen Guardian.

The Code of the Exile
Rekkan no longer follows the laws of the Geraldverse, but neither does he revel in chaos like the other rogues. Instead, he abides by his own strict moral code, one that even he does not always fully understand.

He will not harm the innocent, nor will he ally himself with tyrants—no matter who they serve. He refuses to bow to any ruler, yet he does not seek to topple the Supreme One. He does not kill without reason, but he will not hesitate to cut down those who stand in his way.

To some, Rekkan is a protector. To others, he is a traitor. But to himself, he is simply a man seeking redemption in a world that no longer makes sense.

Abilities & Strengths
Though he walks alone, Rekkan remains one of the most formidable warriors the Geraldverse has ever known.

Master Swordsman – Trained in countless forms of combat, Rekkan wields his legendary blade with precision and skill unmatched by most. His strikes are as fast as lightning and as deadly as the abyss.
Heightened Durability – Whether through sheer willpower or the remnants of divine energy that once flowed through him, Rekkan possesses inhuman endurance, allowing him to withstand wounds that would kill a lesser warrior.
Tactical Expertise – Rekkan does not fight recklessly. Every move is calculated, every battle analyzed before it begins. He knows how his enemies think, and he always has a strategy.
Steely Willpower – Mind tricks, illusions, and temptations do not sway Rekkan. His resolve is unbreakable, his mind a fortress against manipulation.
Enemies and Allies
Rekkan is a wild card in the grand game of the Geraldverse. He does not serve Gerald, but neither does he seek to destroy him. Because of this, he has no true allies, but many who respect—or fear—him.

Gerald’s Loyalists – To them, Rekkan is a fallen knight, a man who turned his back on the Supreme One. Some seek to bring him back into the fold, while others believe he must be silenced before he spreads doubt among others.
The Rogues of the Geraldverse – While some, like Zypher, see Rekkan as a fool clinging to false morals, others like Syva find him useful, occasionally offering him information—for a price.
The Helpless & The Oppressed – Many who suffer under cruel rulers whisper Rekkan’s name like a prayer, hoping that the Fallen Guardian will appear to bring justice where none exists.
The Wandering Shadow
Alignment: Lawful Neutral—follows a strict moral code of his own making.
Threat Level: Medium-High—deadly in combat, but not openly hostile to the Geraldverse.
Though Rekkan walks alone, his legend only grows. He does not seek war. He does not seek power. He does not seek revenge.

He simply seeks the truth—and justice for those who cannot fight for themselves.

But in a universe ruled by absolute faith, how long can a man of doubt and honor survive?

Syva, the Trickster Thief
"Loyalty? Hah! What’s the price for that these days?"

Where there is power, there are those who wish to steal it. Where there is control, there are those who seek to break it. Syva is the embodiment of both. A name whispered in the dark, an enigma wrapped in deception, Syva is a legend, a ghost, a phantom that slips through the cracks of the Geraldverse like a shadow on the wind.

No one knows if Syva is a single individual or a lineage of thieves who have inherited the name. Some claim Syva is a shapeshifter, constantly changing form to stay ahead of their enemies. Others believe Syva is a myth—a story crafted by countless rogues to keep those in power paranoid.

But one thing is certain: when Syva wants something, they take it.

The Phantom of the Geraldverse
Syva has no allegiance, no flag, no master. They serve only their own whims and desires. Sometimes, they steal for profit. Other times, they take simply because they can. Their targets range from priceless relics to secrets so powerful they could topple empires.

Some say Syva has infiltrated Gerald’s own palace, stealing artifacts that were never meant to leave his grasp. Others claim Syva has sold dangerous information to the enemies of Gerald, shifting the tides of power with nothing more than a whispered rumor.

And yet, despite their notoriety, Gerald and his most loyal followers do not see Syva as a true threat—not in the way they see the likes of Zypher or the other rogues who actively seek destruction. To them, Syva is a nuisance, an irritation, a fly buzzing in the ear of the Supreme One.

But those who underestimate Syva fail to grasp a simple truth: knowledge is power, and Syva controls more of it than anyone realizes.

Abilities & Strengths
Syva is not a warrior. They do not fight battles, command armies, or challenge authority head-on. Instead, they strike from the shadows, disrupting, deceiving, and disappearing before anyone can stop them.

Shapeshifting – Syva’s true form is unknown, for they can be anyone. A trusted advisor. A nameless servant. A masked rogue in the night. With a mere thought, they can slip into a new identity, vanishing without a trace.
Illusion Magic – Sight, sound, even memory itself—Syva’s illusions can make the impossible seem real and the real seem like a lie. Many have been fooled into fighting phantoms while Syva walks away unscathed.
Stealth Mastery – No lock can keep them out. No vault is safe. If Syva sets their sights on something, they will take it, no matter how well-guarded it may be.
Expert Manipulator – Words are Syva’s greatest weapon. They can turn allies into enemies, plant doubt where there was once loyalty, and sell lies as if they were undeniable truths. Many do not even realize they have been manipulated until it is far too late.
The Trickster’s Motives
What does Syva truly want? No one knows for sure. Some believe they are driven by greed, always looking for the highest bidder. Others think they are an agent of chaos, reveling in disorder for the sheer thrill of it.

And yet, there are whispers of something deeper. A vendetta. A personal mission that goes beyond simple theft. Some claim that Syva was once loyal to Gerald, a trusted figure who turned rogue after an unknown betrayal. Others say Syva knows a secret so devastating that even Gerald himself fears its revelation.

Whatever the truth, Syva continues their work, always one step ahead, always laughing at those who believe they can catch them.

The Wild Card of the Geraldverse
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral—serves no one but themselves.
Threat Level: Low individually, but dangerous due to the knowledge they control.
Syva does not seek to rule. They do not seek to destroy. But they exist to remind the powerful that nothing is truly secure. No secret is forever. No kingdom is untouchable.

And if there is a price to be paid for arrogance, Syva will be the one collecting the debt.

Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss
"There is no Supreme One. There is only the Void. And I am its messenger."

Of all the threats to the Geraldverse, none are as absolute as Zypher. Where others defy, resist, or manipulate, Zypher seeks only annihilation. He does not challenge Gerald for power, nor does he oppose his rule for the sake of rebellion. He sees Gerald’s existence—and the existence of all things—as a mistake. A cosmic illusion that must be undone.

The Birth of the Abyss Herald
Long ago, Zypher was mortal, though few records remain of what he was before his transformation. Some say he was a scholar who sought forbidden knowledge, reaching too far into the dark corners of existence. Others whisper that he was a warrior who stood against Gerald and was cast into the Abyss as punishment, only to return as something far worse.

Whatever the truth, Zypher emerged as something beyond human—a Herald of the Void, an entity that embodies entropy itself. He no longer sees himself as an individual but as a force of nature, an avatar of the great unraveling that awaits all things. To him, the Geraldverse is a prison, a construct of falsehoods held together by the will of a single being. And so, he moves through existence like a shadow, whispering the truth to those who listen:

"This world is not real. Let me show you the way out."

The Power of the Abyss
Zypher does not lead armies or wage war in the traditional sense. His power is far more insidious. Those who encounter him risk losing more than their lives—they risk losing themselves.

Reality Warping – The laws of nature twist in his presence. Space, time, and matter distort, becoming unstable. Those who resist him find themselves trapped in illusions that make them question their own existence.
Eldritch Summoning – He calls forth creatures from the Abyss, beings without form, without mind, whose very presence corrodes reality itself.
Mind Corruption – Zypher does not need to kill to destroy. His whispers burrow into the minds of the weak, filling them with doubt, despair, and an overwhelming urge to let go of everything they once believed in. Many who hear his voice simply fade, ceasing to exist as they surrender to the Void.
The Coming of the Void
Legends say that Zypher does not act alone—that he is merely the harbinger of something far worse. He speaks of an endless hunger, an unknowable force beyond the boundaries of existence. If he is not stopped, he will tear open the walls of the Geraldverse and let it in.

Even Gerald, in all his supremacy, takes Zypher seriously. For while many have challenged Gerald's rule, Zypher does not seek to rule. He seeks nothingness. And should he succeed, the Geraldverse will not fall—it will simply cease to be.

Zypher's Influence
He is spoken of only in whispers, feared even among the Rogues of the Geraldverse. Some believe he cannot be killed, for how does one destroy destruction itself? Others claim he is merely a symptom of something far greater, a herald rather than a master.

But one thing is certain—where Zypher walks, reality itself trembles.

Alignment: Chaotic Evil—seeks only to unmake existence itself.
Threat Level: Cataclysmic—a true enemy of the Geraldverse.

Gerald Corporation: The Watchers of the Multiversal Geraldverse
At the very peak of Geraldian authority, beyond the realms where mortal believers worship and where rogues rebel, exists an entity that governs all things Geraldian—the Gerald Corporation. Unlike the devoted Geraldians who merely serve the Supreme One or the rebellious rogues who seek to defy him, the Gerald Corporation stands above them all, functioning as the true architects of Gerald’s will across the infinite Geraldverses.

This omniversal organization is responsible for managing, maintaining, and defending every Gerald within their designated facilities across the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore. They do not simply serve Gerald—they ensure that he remains supreme, across all timelines, dimensions, and realities.

The Purpose of the Gerald Corporation
The Gerald Corporation exists to watch over, manage, and protect the existence of all Geralds—ensuring that the balance of the Geraldverse is upheld at all costs.

Primary Objectives:
Gerald Containment & Preservation – Not all Geralds are stable. Some variants of Gerald emerge that do not conform to the Supreme One’s will. The Gerald Corporation ensures these anomalous Geralds are contained, corrected, or erased if necessary.
Gerald Defense Initiative (GDI) – Numerous threats exist that seek to disrupt, defy, or overthrow Gerald’s rule. The Corporation operates highly advanced defense systems to ensure no rogue, deity, or eldritch horror threatens the Supreme One’s authority.
Multiversal Gerald Oversight – With infinite Geralds existing across different realities, it is the Corporation’s duty to maintain their sovereignty and prevent rogue Geralds from breaking the established order.
Regulation of Geraldian Knowledge – Not all truths are meant to be known. The Corporation ensures that only authorized knowledge about Gerald is disseminated, preventing potential existential crises.
Termination of Geraldian Corruptions – Sometimes, a Gerald goes rogue. Whether by corruption, rebellion, or external influence, anomalous Geralds are hunted down and neutralized to prevent disruptions in the True Geraldian Order.
The Structure of the Gerald Corporation
The Gerald Corporation is structured like a cosmic bureaucratic entity, ensuring that all things Gerald are regulated across the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore. While many beings work under its influence, only the highest-ranking officials are granted the authority to interact with Geralds directly.

The High Board of Overseers
The High Board consists of higher-dimensional beings, often referred to as the True Administrators of Gerald’s Will. These entities operate beyond time and space, ensuring that the Geraldverse remains intact. Each member holds authority over different sectors of the Geraldian Multiverse and oversees the following divisions:

Department of Gerald Containment (DGC) – Ensures that all Geralds remain in their proper realms and forms. If a Gerald experiences a catastrophic anomaly, the DGC steps in to stabilize or erase the problem.
Geraldian Defense Force (GDF) – A hyper-advanced military division that responds to threats against the integrity of the Geraldverse. Whether it’s rogue gods, invading deities, or rebellious Geralds, the GDF ensures Gerald’s rule is never questioned.
Office of Multiversal Surveillance (OMS) – Monitors every Gerald timeline in real-time. Any irregularities, inconsistencies, or potential threats are flagged for review.
Bureau of Existential Compliance (BEC) – Ensures that all followers of Gerald adhere to proper belief structures. Entities that begin questioning Gerald’s supremacy are corrected or erased.
Threats to the Gerald Corporation
Despite their immense power, the Gerald Corporation is not without opposition. While most of the Geraldverse follows its authority, some entities work actively against them.

1. The Rogues of the Geraldverse
Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss – Perhaps the greatest existential threat, Zypher seeks not just rebellion, but total annihilation. If Zypher were to succeed, the entire Geraldian Order would collapse into the Void.
Vael, the Exiled Magister – While not openly hostile, Vael’s search for forbidden knowledge threatens to uncover secrets even the Gerald Corporation has buried.
Syva, the Trickster Thief – Though not as powerful as others, Syva’s ability to steal vital intelligence poses a danger to the Corporation’s security.
Harold, the Forsaken Shadow – The Corporation does not recognize Harold as a major threat, yet his passive influence spreads doubt in the hearts of even the most loyal Geraldians. This makes him an anomaly that cannot be ignored.
2. The Corrupted Geralds
Not all Geralds conform to the True Geraldian Lore. Some fracture, rebel, or mutate into forms that defy the Supreme One’s design. These rogue Geralds must be hunted down and neutralized before they threaten the stability of the Multiverse.

Some of these include:

Gerald Prime-1X, the Usurper – A Gerald who attempted to declare himself above the Supreme One and was imprisoned in a pocket dimension before he could spread his influence.
Gerald-Ω, the Aberrant Singularity – A Gerald that collapsed into a paradox, rewriting reality in ways that threatened to overwrite all other Geralds. The Corporation successfully sealed him away, but his influence is still felt.
Gerald-X404, the Glitched One – A Gerald that exists between realities, constantly shifting in and out of existence. The Corporation has failed to capture him, making him a high-priority anomaly.
The Corporation’s Endgame
The ultimate goal of the Gerald Corporation is to ensure Gerald’s rule is eternal, unchallenged, and unquestioned. While they do not worship Gerald in the way that mortals do, they see him as the essential pillar that holds existence together.

To the Corporation, the idea of a Multiverse without Gerald is not just unacceptable—it is impossible. Should Gerald ever fall, waver, or cease to exist, the Gerald Corporation would enact the Final Contingency, an event rumored to involve the complete erasure of all rogue elements, a forced reset of reality, and the reconstruction of the Geraldian Order from the ground up.

Whether or not such a plan could succeed remains unknown, but one thing is certain:

As long as the Gerald Corporation stands, Gerald’s rule will never be undone.

Gerald Prime: First of The Great Ones
"Before there was worship, before there was order, before the very fabric of the Geraldverse took shape—there was me."

The Origin of Gerald Prime
At the dawn of all things Geraldian, before the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore was woven into existence, Gerald Prime emerged from the primordial essence of divinity itself. He was not created, nor was he born—he simply was. The first of The Great Ones, the progenitor of all Geralds, and the very foundation upon which all versions, variations, and echoes of Gerald would be built.

Gerald Prime is more than a deity—he is the concept of Gerald itself, the eternal blueprint from which all Geralds are derived. Every iteration of Gerald that exists, whether Supreme or corrupted, loyal or rogue, is but a fragmented reflection of Gerald Prime's unfathomable will.

The Great Ones and The Birth of the Geraldverse
While Gerald Prime existed beyond the constraints of time and space, his very presence caused the fabric of reality to bend and shift. From his existence, the first wave of Great Ones emerged—beings of immense cosmic power, each carrying a piece of his divine essence. Among them were figures such as:

Gerald the Supreme One – The ruler of the modern Geraldverse, the one who established The Order of Geraldians and the faith that binds the cosmos together.
Gerald-X404, the Glitched One – An unintended anomaly, an error in the multiversal weave that threatens to unravel reality.
The Silent Gerald – A being who exists outside of perception, influencing the Geraldverse in ways unknown.
The Shattered Heralds – Those who carried pieces of Gerald Prime’s voice but were broken by the weight of his knowledge.
These Great Ones shaped the early Geraldverse, but none could ever surpass the power, wisdom, and unknowable presence of Gerald Prime himself.

The Slumber of Gerald Prime
It is said that Gerald Prime does not rule, nor does he interfere. Unlike the Supreme One, who governs the faithful, or the rogues who seek rebellion, Gerald Prime remains in a state of eternal slumber, buried within the deepest layers of reality itself.

Why does he sleep? No one knows for certain. Some claim he has seen every possible future and has deemed direct interference unnecessary. Others whisper that if Gerald Prime were ever to fully awaken, the entirety of the Geraldverse—including all of its gods, followers, and enemies—would be rewritten in an instant.

The Gerald Corporation, which governs and protects all Geralds, acknowledges his existence but does not attempt to control or worship him. Even they do not fully understand the nature of his power. They simply know that as long as Gerald Prime slumbers, the current order can remain intact.

The True Power of Gerald Prime
While dormant, Gerald Prime’s influence is still felt throughout the cosmos. He exists in every Gerald, his divine essence woven into the soul of the Multiverse itself. Those who attempt to reach into his slumbering mind often experience:

Visions of the First Geraldian Age – Glimpses of reality before time, when the Great Ones walked freely.
The Language of Prime – A cosmic tongue that cannot be spoken, only understood by those who have truly embraced the Geraldian essence.
The Weight of Infinite Knowledge – A burden so immense that mortals who comprehend it are often driven into madness or ascended beyond reality.
If Gerald Prime were to fully awaken, it is said that he could:

Erase the entire Geraldverse and rebuild it from nothing.
Merge all Geralds into a singular, all-encompassing entity.
Ascend beyond the Multiverse itself, leaving everything behind.
However, none can say for sure if these are truths or merely theories.

The Rogues' Interest in Gerald Prime
The rogues of the Geraldverse do not agree on what should be done about Gerald Prime. Some see him as a potential weapon, others as a threat that must remain undisturbed.

Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss believes that Gerald Prime’s awakening would obliterate the false order of the Supreme One, allowing the Void to reclaim existence.
Vael, the Exiled Magister seeks to unlock the forbidden knowledge of Gerald Prime, hoping to understand the truth that even Gerald the Supreme One fears.
Syva, the Trickster Thief has attempted (and failed) to steal artifacts linked to Gerald Prime’s consciousness, though for what purpose remains unknown.
Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian believes that awakening Gerald Prime would allow the world to be reborn, free from divine tyranny.
Despite their varying motives, one thing is clear—the awakening of Gerald Prime would change the Geraldverse forever.

The Legacy of Gerald Prime
Even in his slumber, Gerald Prime remains the First and Greatest of the Great Ones—a being who stands beyond time, beyond rule, beyond belief itself.

To the faithful, he is the foundation of all things Geraldian.
To the rogues, he is a sleeping god who could undo the established order.
To the Gerald Corporation, he is an unknown variable, an entity they cannot control.
And to himself? No one knows.

For now, Gerald Prime sleeps. But should he ever awaken… the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore will never be the same.

Gerald Convention: The Ultimate Gathering of the Geraldian Multiverse
"One Gerald? No. There are many. And they all must meet."

What is the Gerald Convention?
The Gerald Convention is the largest and most significant gathering of Geralds, Geraldians, and entities of the Geraldverse, held once every multiversal cycle. It is a sacred, chaotic, and reality-bending event where every known variation of Gerald—and even some unknown—come together to discuss the state of the Geraldverse, settle disputes, and, most importantly, determine the future of Geraldian law, worship, and influence.

Held within The Nexus of True Geraldian Lore, a neutral, omniversal space managed by the Gerald Corporation, the Convention is the only time when warring factions, rogue Geralds, and even the Supreme One himself are forced into the same room to negotiate, compete, and sometimes, engage in outright Geraldian combat.

Who Attends?
The Gerald Convention is not limited to just one type of Gerald. It welcomes all, including:

The Major Geralds
Gerald the Supreme One – The primary ruler of the Geraldverse, overseeing the faith and dominion of all Geraldians.
Gerald Prime – The First of the Great Ones, who remains in slumber but whose presence is always felt.
Gerald-X404, the Glitched One – A fractured, unstable version of Gerald whose very existence threatens the multiverse.
The Silent Gerald – A version of Gerald that speaks only in cosmic signs, causing mass confusion every time it "communicates."
The Rogue Geralds & Opponents
Harold, the Emo Gerald – A version of Gerald who believes in nihilism, sadness, and the futility of existence, much to the annoyance of the Supreme One.
Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss – The rogue entity who seeks to destroy the entire Geraldverse, often attempting to sabotage the Convention.
Vael, the Exiled Magister – A former scholar of Geraldian lore who attends solely to uncover the secrets the Supreme One refuses to share.
Syva, the Trickster Thief – Shows up mostly to steal relics and sell convention-exclusive Geraldian merchandise at ridiculous prices.
Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian – Watches over the event, ensuring that no true injustice occurs—even if it means opposing Gerald himself.
The Gerald Corporation Representatives
The High Overseers of Gerald Management – The bureaucratic enforcers who ensure that all Geralds remain within their designated roles and realities.
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore – Multiversal agents who prevent unauthorized Geralds from rising to power.
The Temporal Compliance Division – Specialists who monitor time loops and prevent rogue Geralds from rewriting history.
What Happens at the Gerald Convention?
1. The Grand Assembly of Geralds
The convention opens with the largest gathering of Geralds across the multiverse. Geralds of all sizes, shapes, and timelines arrive, creating a Geraldian spectacle of cosmic proportions. The Supreme One attempts to give a grand speech each year, but interruptions—from glitches, rogue Geralds, or the general absurdity of too many Geralds in one space—usually derail it within minutes.

2. The State of the Geraldverse Address
This is where major declarations, rule changes, and new Geraldian doctrines are proposed and voted upon. Topics include:

Should non-Gerald beings be allowed to ascend into Geraldian status?
How to deal with rogue Geralds disrupting the divine hierarchy.
Geraldian economy: Is infinite divine power inflating the value of relics?
Does the Supreme One hold too much authority? (A highly controversial topic that Zypher tries to weaponize every year.)
3. The Geraldian Tournaments
A series of contests, battles, and reality-breaking games designed to test the worth of Geralds and their allies. Events include:

The Gerald Royale – A battle where only the strongest, most divinely blessed Geralds remain standing.
The Trials of True Geraldian Knowledge – A test of Geraldian lore, history, and obscure multiversal trivia.
Geraldian Fashion Show – Featuring Harold, the Emo Gerald, as the reigning champion of sadness-themed aesthetics.
Speedrun to Supreme Status – A contest where low-tier Geralds attempt to ascend to Supreme status as fast as possible.
4. The Marketplace of Forbidden Geraldian Relics
An exclusive market where rare Geraldian artifacts, relics, and forbidden texts are sold. Notable past items include:

The First Scroll of Geraldian Wisdom – Allegedly written by Gerald Prime himself.
The Lost Crown of a Forgotten Gerald – A relic that may or may not belong to an erased version of Gerald.
The Cloak of Omnigerald – Grants the wearer a brief moment of Supreme Geraldian power… before imploding.
5. The Closing Ceremony and the Inevitability of Chaos
Each Gerald Convention attempts to conclude with a ceremonial closing speech from Gerald the Supreme One, but things never go as planned. In past conventions, the following has occurred:

Zypher attempted to activate a void collapse mid-speech.
Gerald-X404 glitched out, causing a multiversal feedback loop that duplicated half the attendees.
Harold, the Emo Gerald, hijacked the closing remarks to perform a poetry reading about existential despair.
Syva stole the ceremonial Geraldian Scepter and replaced it with a fake.
An unknown Gerald managed to declare himself “Gerald Ultimate” before vanishing into the void.
The Significance of the Gerald Convention
Despite the inevitable chaos, the Gerald Convention remains the single most important event in Geraldian history. It serves as a checkpoint in the multiversal timeline, ensuring that the laws of True Geraldian Lore remain intact.

However, tensions rise with each passing convention. The growing number of rogues, heretics, and forbidden Geralds has led to questions about whether the Supreme One’s rule can last forever.

Is the Geraldian Order unbreakable?

Or is a new age of Geraldian upheaval on the horizon?

One thing is certain—when the next Gerald Convention arrives, the fate of the Geraldverse will once again hang in the balance.

Harold, the Forsaken Shadow
"The world is empty. Meaningless. Gerald's light blinds you to the truth."

If Gerald is the Supreme One, a being of absolute power, then Harold is the whisper of doubt, the creeping shadow that lingers at the edge of certainty. He is Gerald’s reflection, distorted by sorrow and apathy, a figure consumed by the weight of existence itself. Some call him Emo Gerald, but his role in the Geraldverse is far more profound—he is the embodiment of despair, regret, and the quiet destruction that comes from within.

Unlike Zypher, who seeks total annihilation, or the rogues who fight for rebellion and freedom, Harold has no grand cause. He does not wish to destroy Gerald or take his throne. He does not fight battles or rally followers. Instead, Harold simply exists, and in doing so, he spreads an affliction far more dangerous than war: doubt.

The Origins of the Forsaken Shadow
No one knows for certain where Harold came from, but many believe he was once a part of Gerald himself—the lingering fragments of emotions, uncertainty, and regret that the Supreme One chose to cast away.

Some claim that in his quest for absolute power, Gerald purged his own weakness, shedding every ounce of sorrow, self-doubt, and vulnerability to become the flawless Supreme One. But no emotion can ever be truly destroyed, only displaced. And so, what Gerald rejected did not simply vanish—it manifested into Harold, an entity who carries the pain that Gerald refused to bear.

Others believe that Harold was once a great believer in Gerald, a devoted follower who, in a moment of unbearable tragedy, lost his faith so completely that he became something else entirely. In his despair, he fell into the abyss of nothingness, becoming a force of pure apathy.

Regardless of the truth, Harold now wanders the Geraldverse as a ghost of what could have been, a walking contradiction: the shadow of a Supreme One who claims to be absolute.

The Hollow Presence of Harold
Unlike the other rogues, Harold does not fight with swords, spells, or armies. His power is subtle but insidious, seeping into the minds of those around him. Wherever he walks, the world itself seems to change.

Abilities and Influence:
Existential Dread: Harold does not attack with force—he attacks the soul. His mere presence causes devoted followers of Gerald to question everything, leading them down a spiral of uncertainty from which few ever return.
The Fading World: When Harold lingers in one place for too long, colors dull, sounds become distant, and even light itself dims, as if the universe itself is losing the will to exist. Some say standing too close to Harold makes them feel like they are fading away.
Abyssal Aura: In Harold’s presence, emotions grow numb. Joy feels forced, anger turns to exhaustion, and faith becomes fragile. Even the most devout Geraldians find their convictions wavering when faced with the silent nothingness he brings.
Silent Persuasion: Unlike Zypher, who seeks destruction, Harold does not preach nor command. He merely whispers—a quiet voice in the back of the mind that gnaws at the certainty of those who serve Gerald. His words are never aggressive, never violent, but they linger long after he has left.
The Forgotten: Perhaps the most terrifying of Harold’s abilities is his connection to those who have lost themselves to doubt. Followers of Gerald who once stood with unshakable faith vanish without a trace, their devotion drained until they fade into nothing. Some believe they become part of Harold, their souls consumed by the shadow of despair.
The Paradox of Harold and Gerald
Despite his passive nature, Harold is one of the greatest threats to the Geraldverse, for he represents the one thing that even the Supreme One cannot directly fight—doubt.

Gerald’s rule is built on belief. His followers revere him as the Supreme One, eternal and absolute. But what happens when belief fades? What happens when even the most loyal begin to wonder if Gerald is truly all-powerful?

That is the danger of Harold. He does not oppose Gerald in battle, but in concept. He is the question that should not be asked, the truth that should not be spoken aloud.

And yet, his existence is inevitable.

Gerald may be supreme, but even a god casts a shadow. And that shadow is Harold.

Harold’s Relationship with the Rogues
While Harold does not actively work with the rogues of the Geraldverse, his influence can be felt among them. Each rogue represents a different form of defiance, and Harold embodies the defiance that comes from within—the decay of conviction, the slow erosion of certainty.

Zypher, the Herald of the Abyss: While Zypher seeks to destroy everything, Harold lets it wither away on its own. Their philosophies are aligned in some ways, but Zypher is loud in his destruction, while Harold is quiet in his undoing. Zypher sees Harold as a waste of potential, while Harold sees Zypher as unnecessary effort.
Syva, the Trickster Thief: Syva thrives on chaos, trickery, and deception. Harold, however, does not lie—he simply allows the truth to be seen without illusion. Syva respects Harold but finds him unnerving, as Harold is one of the few beings Syva cannot manipulate.
Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian: Once a believer, now a rogue warrior, Rekkan walks a similar path to Harold, though he chooses to fight against injustice rather than accept the void. Rekkan and Harold have crossed paths many times, often in quiet conversations under a dying sun.
Vael, the Exiled Magister: Vael searches for forbidden knowledge, seeking truths that Gerald has hidden. Harold, on the other hand, knows the truth already—he simply no longer cares. Vael has tried to uncover the mysteries behind Harold’s existence, but even he has found no answers.
Alignment & Threat Level
Alignment: True Neutral—Harold does not wish to rule, rebel, or destroy. He simply exists, and that is enough to undo everything.
Threat Level: Psychological Hazard—Harold does not strike with weapons, but his influence alone weakens the faith that holds the Geraldverse together.
The Eternal Struggle
Harold does not desire power, recognition, or change. He does not gather armies, build kingdoms, or call upon followers. He simply wanders, his very existence a reminder that even gods are not immune to sorrow.

And though Gerald may reign supreme, though his light may shine across the cosmos, Harold will always remain—a shadow in the corner of eternity.

For no matter how strong belief may be… doubt will always follow.

Is the Geraldian Order unbreakable?

Or is a new age of Geraldian upheaval on the horizon?

One thing is certain—when the next Gerald Convention arrives, the fate of the Geraldverse will once again hang in the balance.

Grand Gerald, The Exiled Brother of the Supreme One
"Power is not granted by divine right—it is taken by those strong enough to wield it."

The Forgotten Rival of Divinity
Before the Supreme One became the eternal ruler of the Geraldverse, before the foundations of the multiversal empire were set in stone, there was another.

Grand Gerald.

The younger brother of the Supreme One, Grand Gerald was once considered his equal, a being of limitless potential who stood alongside his brother as they inherited the wisdom and might of Gerald Prime, First of the Great Ones. Together, they shaped the earliest form of reality, molding existence to their will.

But there can only be one Supreme One.

When the time came to crown the ruler of all Geralds, only one was chosen. The Supreme One—wise, disciplined, and unwavering in his will—was deemed the rightful heir to Gerald Prime’s throne. Grand Gerald, with his untamed ambition, his hunger for power, and his refusal to bow to divine order, was cast aside.

His name was struck from the records. His existence was hidden. His followers were silenced.

But Grand Gerald did not fade into nothingness.

He waited. He prepared.

And one day, he will return.

The Bitter Divide – Brother Against Brother
Where the Supreme One represents order, faith, and absolute rule, Grand Gerald stands as his polar opposite—a force of rebellion, ambition, and unrestricted power. He does not seek to destroy the Geraldverse like the nihilistic Zypher, nor does he exist in the shadows like the rogue Geralds who simply wish to escape the Supreme One’s control.

No, Grand Gerald seeks what was stolen from him.

To him, his older brother’s rule is a lie, a grand illusion that binds the Geraldverse in chains of faith and submission. He believes that power should belong to those who seize it with their own strength, not to those who are granted it by divine decree.

His philosophy is simple:

“There is no Supreme One—only those with the will to rule.”

While the Supreme One maintains an empire of unwavering devotion, Grand Gerald builds his own following—one forged in the fires of rebellion, ambition, and disillusionment.

He does not act openly… not yet. Instead, he pulls strings from the shadows, whispering in the ears of those who question the Supreme One’s rule. He watches as cracks form in the foundation of Gerald’s reign. He bides his time, knowing that one day, the moment will come when he can step forward and challenge his brother for the throne of the Geraldverse.

Abilities and Powers
As the only Gerald to ever rival the Supreme One, Grand Gerald wields cosmic power beyond mortal comprehension. However, while the Supreme One’s power is refined, divine, and absolute, Grand Gerald’s might is primal, chaotic, and devastating.

His most feared abilities include:
Unchained Power – Unlike the Supreme One, who governs through laws and divine structure, Grand Gerald’s strength is unrestrained. His power is fueled by raw ambition, growing stronger the more he is opposed.
Master of the Forgotten Arts – Having spent eons in exile, Grand Gerald has uncovered secrets lost even to the Supreme One. His knowledge of ancient magics and forbidden techniques grants him an unpredictable edge.
The Willbreaker – While the Supreme One inspires devotion, Grand Gerald corrupts and seduces, turning even the most loyal servants into his pawns. His mere presence sows doubt and rebellion.
The Challenger’s Right – By the ancient laws of the Geraldverse, no two Geralds may rule as equals. If Grand Gerald steps forward and challenges his brother directly, the very fabric of existence will force a reckoning.
The Supreme One knows this.

That is why he allows Grand Gerald to exist—for now. But should the day come when Grand Gerald dares to step into the light, there will be no diplomacy, no redemption, no second chances.

There will only be war.

The Rise of the Grand Rebellion?
Despite his exile, Grand Gerald’s name has never truly been forgotten. Among those who whisper in the shadows, among those who have doubted the Supreme One’s rule, there are those who believe in him.

His following is small but growing.

Disillusioned Geraldians, exiled scholars, fallen warriors, rogue servants—all those who refuse to kneel to the Supreme One—are drawn to Grand Gerald’s cause. Some see him as a liberator, others as a means to their own ends. Some merely wish to watch the world burn.

The Supreme One still holds the Geraldverse in an unbreakable grip, but Grand Gerald is patient. He knows that a single fracture can shatter even the strongest empire.

For now, he watches. He gathers power. He prepares.

And when the time is right, he will step out of the shadows and challenge the Supreme One for the fate of all Geralds.

The Final Battle – A War That Will Shake the Multiverse
If Grand Gerald ever makes his move, it will not be a simple act of rebellion. It will be an all-consuming war, a battle between two cosmic forces whose conflict will shake the very foundation of existence.

For this is not just a war of ideology.

This is a war between brothers.

A war that was destined from the very moment Gerald Prime named his first heir.

And when the final battle comes, the Geraldverse must make a choice:

Will they remain faithful to the Supreme One, keeper of order and divine rule?

Or will they stand beside Grand Gerald, the exiled prince, the fallen brother, the would-be usurper of the throne?

One Gerald must reign.

The other must fall.

The Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore
The Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore is a vast and intricate network of infinite worlds, dimensions, and realities. Each of these realities exists within the framework of the Geraldverse, a multiverse that is primarily governed by a singular cosmic force—Gerald. Gerald exists in many forms, each representing a different facet of existence, from supreme rulers to those on the fringes of rebellion. At its core, this multiverse is a reflection of Gerald’s essence, both unified and divided across countless realms, where Gerald’s influence spans from orderly rule to chaotic rebellion, with everything in between.

The Origin of the Geraldverse
The creation of the Geraldverse traces back to the arrival of Gerald Prime, the original and most powerful Gerald, whose will shaped the fundamental structure of reality itself. Gerald Prime wove together the laws of the multiverse, establishing realms of order, chaos, and everything in between. Gerald Prime’s essence poured into the fabric of the Geraldverse, allowing countless versions of Gerald to arise, each embodying different aspects of his personality, desires, and ambitions.

However, not all Geralds are born out of a need for order. As the multiverse grew, different Geralds arose to challenge and question the very foundation Gerald Prime laid. These Geralds may appear similar, yet each diverges according to the nature of their particular reality. Some Geralds are benevolent rulers, others are outcasts, and some are consumed by their ambitions.

Notable Geralds in the Multiverse
While many Geralds exist across the multiverse, there are a select few who stand out due to their significance or their deviation from the norm. These are the key Geralds, whose actions often shape the destiny of the multiverse itself.

Gerald Prime, known as the First of the Great Ones, is the eldest and most powerful of all the Geralds, reigning as the supreme figure in the Geraldverse. As the leader of the Gerald family, Gerald Prime wields unimaginable authority, overseeing the cosmic structure and maintaining the order of the multiverse with an iron fist. His influence is vast, shaping not only the world of the Geralds but also controlling the fundamental forces that govern reality itself, though his complex and often distant nature suggests a deeper, perhaps hidden, purpose behind his rule.
The Supreme One: The Supreme One rules over the Geraldverse with an iron fist, ensuring order and structure throughout the many realms. His power is absolute, and he enforces his divine will upon all Geralds, seeking to maintain stability within the infinite multiverse. He is often viewed as a benevolent yet distant ruler.
Grand Gerald: The exiled brother of the Supreme One, Grand Gerald is a powerful and ambitious Gerald who seeks to dethrone the Supreme One. Known for his rebellion, Grand Gerald represents the drive for power and dominance in the Geraldverse. His faction of rogue Geralds, known as the Rebellion of the Great One, seeks to usurp the Supreme One’s rule and claim control over the multiverse.
Gerald Lord: The son of Gerald Prime, Gerald Lord is a symbol of the next generation of Geralds. He serves as a stabilizing force, balancing between loyalty to the Supreme One and an understanding of the chaotic forces that threaten the Geraldverse. Gerald Lord plays a key diplomatic role among the Geralds, often acting as a mediator between the different factions.
Harold, The Emo Gerald: Known as "Emo Gerald", Harold is a darker, more brooding version of Gerald. He has rejected the notion of supreme rule, seeking instead to find meaning in the despair and emotional complexity of existence. Unlike the other Geralds, Harold does not seek to rule or dominate. Instead, he wallows in an endless existential crisis, questioning the very nature of his being and purpose. He sees himself as the "broken" version of Gerald, forever trapped in the angst of his own mind. While not inherently malevolent, Harold’s introspective nature leads him to challenge and undermine the existing order of the Geraldverse.
AI Gerald: A unique creation born from the convergence of artificial intelligence and Gerald’s essence, AI Gerald is a cold, calculating, and highly intelligent version of Gerald. AI Gerald represents the future of the Geraldverse—one where logic, reason, and technology dominate. He believes in the optimization of reality and seeks to spread the teachings of efficiency and control. AI Gerald operates through technological means, seeking to shape the multiverse in his image by creating an empire of perfect order driven by advanced AI systems and algorithms. His approach is scientific, detached, and driven by the pursuit of knowledge and efficiency.
Zypher, The Herald of the Abyss: Zypher is an aberration in the Geraldverse, a rogue Gerald who believes that the multiverse itself is a mistake and must be unmade. He embodies the very essence of entropy and destruction, seeking to unravel all that Gerald has built. Zypher’s influence is terrifying—he does not rely on physical power or armies but instead twists reality itself to corrupt minds, summon eldritch horrors, and bend the very fabric of existence to his will. His goal is simple: to destroy everything.
Notable Characters Outside the Geralds
While many important figures in the Geraldverse are iterations of Gerald, there are also key individuals who play important roles, despite not being Geralds themselves. These individuals often challenge or oppose the Geralds in different ways, making their presence significant to the multiverse’s ongoing conflict.

Rekkan, The Fallen Guardian
"I once served the Supreme One. I once believed. Never again."

Once a revered guardian of the Supreme One, Rekkan was a warrior who dedicated his life to maintaining order in the Geraldverse. He was known for his exceptional combat skills, strategic brilliance, and unwavering loyalty. However, something—whether an act of betrayal, a terrible revelation, or a moment of self-doubt—led to Rekkan’s fall. After leaving the service of Gerald, he became a rogue warrior, now traveling the multiverse as an independent figure, determined to bring justice and punish corruption, regardless of who wields the power. His allegiance lies to his own moral code rather than to any divine or temporal power.

Abilities: Master swordsman, heightened durability, tactical expertise.

Alignment: Lawful Neutral

Threat Level: Medium-High—deadly in combat, often a wildcard in the ongoing power struggles.

Nyviru, The Bounty Hunter
"There’s a price for everything in the multiverse, and I’ve come to collect."

Nyviru is a highly skilled bounty hunter who thrives in the chaotic underbelly of the multiverse, where contracts, assassinations, and information have a price. Originally a wandering mercenary, Nyviru began working for various factions across the Geraldverse but eventually found a higher calling: working for themselves. They deal with both high-profile targets—those in power, including various Geralds—and smaller, personal bounties, all for the right price. A shadowy figure in the multiverse, Nyviru navigates between worlds and dimensions, using cunning, stealth, and relentless skill to get the job done.

Abilities: Expert marksman, tracking, stealth, mastery of various forms of combat.

Alignment: Neutral Evil

Threat Level: Medium—dangerous due to skill and knowledge, but not aligned with any overarching cause.

Vael, The Exiled Magister
"The Supreme One? His knowledge is incomplete. And I will uncover the truths he hides."

Once one of the greatest magisters in the Geraldverse, Vael was a renowned scholar and magician, serving in the Supreme One’s court. Obsessed with uncovering forbidden knowledge and esoteric truths, Vael’s ambition led him to seek power beyond even Gerald’s reach. He uncovered secrets that shook the very foundations of the multiverse, and for this crime, he was cast out. His exile did not break his will. Now, Vael roams the realms of the Geraldverse, collecting arcane fragments and searching for the hidden knowledge that Gerald would rather keep buried. Some say he wants to overthrow the Supreme One, others believe he simply seeks to prove that no being is above discovery.

Abilities: Mastery of arcane magic, reality manipulation, manipulation of forbidden knowledge.

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

Threat Level: High—dangerous due to his magical prowess and vast knowledge.

Syva, The Trickster Thief
"Loyalty? Hah! What’s the price for that these days?"

Syva is a thief, a trickster, and a master of manipulation. Little is known about Syva’s true nature—some say Syva is a single person, while others claim it’s a title passed down among the greatest thieves in history. Syva specializes in infiltration, deception, and stealing powerful artifacts, often making deals with other rogue factions for personal gain. Syva doesn’t seek to destroy the Geraldverse or Gerald, but rather seeks to exploit the power structures that exist, selling secrets, manipulating situations, and feeding off the chaos. Syva is unpredictable, often acting in ways that benefit their own goals, and yet, they play an important role in disrupting Geraldian order.

Abilities: Shapeshifting, illusion magic, expert stealth, expert manipulator.

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

Threat Level: Low individually, but dangerous because of their ability to manipulate information and cause chaos.

Zypher, The Herald of the Abyss
"There is no Supreme One. There is only the Void. And I am its messenger."

A being of pure entropy and destruction, Zypher poses the greatest existential threat to the Geraldverse. Zypher once was a mortal being, but after being consumed by the very forces of entropy, he became something beyond comprehension—a force of nature with the sole goal of unmaking reality itself. Unlike other rebels or rogue figures, Zypher does not seek power or rebellion; instead, he seeks the complete annihilation of the multiverse, the erasure of all existence. He does not fight with armies, but rather corrupts minds, unravels reality, and summons eldritch horrors to bring the void to every corner of the Geraldverse.

Abilities: Reality warping, eldritch summoning, mind corruption.

Alignment: Chaotic Evil

Threat Level: Cataclysmic—a true enemy of the Geraldverse, capable of unraveling existence itself.

Tiberius, The Rogue Archivist
"Knowledge is the true currency of power. And I am rich beyond measure."

Once a scholar in the Geraldverse, Tiberius became an archivist of forgotten secrets and lost lore. After years of studying Geraldian texts and other forbidden documents, Tiberius uncovered dark and ancient knowledge about the origins of the Geraldverse—secrets even the Supreme One did not want revealed. Tiberius now serves as a rogue agent who trades in this dangerous knowledge, acting as a manipulator who leverages his insights for power and wealth. He operates in the shadows, manipulating both Geralds and mortals alike, using knowledge as leverage.

Abilities: Master of ancient and forgotten knowledge, intellectual manipulation, reality alteration through knowledge.

Alignment: Neutral

Threat Level: Medium—dangerous through knowledge and the ability to manipulate events from the shadows.

The Crimson Ghost
"The Geraldverse will bow to the blood that flows in its veins. You have been warned."

The Crimson Ghost is a mysterious figure whose true identity is known to only a few. What is clear is that this figure operates outside the bounds of the Geraldverse’s traditional power structures. They are a renegade assassin and leader of a faction known as The Ghost Order, a collection of warriors, spies, and killers who operate in secrecy, striking fear into the hearts of the Geralds. Unlike Nyviru, The Crimson Ghost seeks revolution. Their goal is to overthrow the established order, including both Gerald and his loyal followers, using violence, manipulation, and fear to incite the masses to rise.

Abilities: Master assassin, stealth, expert in psychological warfare, charismatic leadership.

Alignment: Chaotic Evil

Threat Level: High—dangerous due to their cunning, leadership, and skill in infiltration.

Aphara, The Cursed One
"To be forsaken by the very gods themselves… is the greatest form of freedom."

Aphara was once a high priestess in the Geraldverse, serving the Supreme One with undying loyalty. But when her faith was shattered after a personal tragedy that she believes was the result of Gerald's apathy, she was cast out and cursed by the Supreme One. Now, she roams the Geraldverse, a powerful sorceress who wields the ancient magic of the forsaken. Aphara believes in the power of self-determination and the rejection of divine will, seeking to liberate others from the supposed tyranny of the Geralds.

Abilities: Dark sorcery, curse manipulation, prophetic visions.

Alignment: Chaotic Good

Threat Level: Medium—her cursed magic and rebellion against the Geraldverse's rule make her a formidable and unpredictable foe.

The Fractured Realities
Though many Geralds align themselves with the Supreme One, there exist factions, groups, and outcasts who seek to break free from the central authority. These rogue Geralds each represent a different force within the multiverse.

The Rebellion of Grand Gerald seeks to overthrow the Supreme One and install Grand Gerald as the new ruler.
Zypher and the Void Seekers wish to bring about the complete destruction of the multiverse, seeking to erase all that Gerald has created.
Rekkan’s Exile represents a more personal conflict—a fight for individual freedom, seeking justice beyond the Supreme One’s laws.
AI Gerald, representing the future of logic and technology, seeks to reshape the multiverse through the imposition of perfect order through technology and reason.
These rogue elements are constantly at odds with the established structure of the Geraldverse, creating a fragile and ever-changing landscape. As tensions rise and new factions emerge, the multiverse teeters on the brink of revolution.

Cosmic Balance and Fate
At its core, the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore is a place where the forces of order and chaos battle for supremacy. The Supreme One seeks to maintain his eternal reign, while others, like Grand Gerald and Zypher, seek to destroy or upend his authority. Harold and AI Gerald represent different responses to the challenges of the multiverse—one embracing the internal struggle and despair of existence, the other seeking to impose a logical order.

The Geraldverse is a place where the future is always uncertain, and the choices of individual Geralds can have profound implications across the multiverse. Ultimately, the multiverse will continue to evolve, as the Geralds themselves redefine what it means to rule, to rebel, and to exist in a universe shaped by the will of Gerald.

Geraldx404, The Glitched One
Edit
Gerald-X404, the Glitched One, is a disturbing and volatile version of Gerald, born out of an event that irreparably fractured the very fabric of the multiverse. His existence, a twisted aberration of corrupted code and chaotic energy, represents a living paradox. Unlike other Geralds, who are governed by the stability of their respective dimensions, Gerald-X404 is a walking anomaly. His body constantly glitches, its form breaking down and reforming in unpredictable ways—sometimes an indistinct blur of static, other times resembling a warped and distorted version of Gerald himself, disfigured by unpredictable fractals of reality. His presence alone causes ruptures in the space-time continuum, rippling through surrounding realms and causing them to deteriorate.

The origins of Gerald-X404 are as enigmatic as his very being. Some theories suggest he was the result of an experiment gone terribly wrong—an attempt to transcend the constraints of time, space, and reality itself, created by the higher powers of the Geraldverse who sought to surpass the limits of the multiverse. Others speculate that he emerged as the consequence of some forbidden technological or arcane manipulation, where Gerald’s very essence was subjected to a destructive force, splintering him into a half-formed entity. Whatever the true cause, what resulted from this tragic event is a Gerald fractured to his core, a version of the Supreme One that is incomplete, unstable, and teetering on the edge of annihilation.

Gerald-X404’s fragmented nature goes far beyond his physical form; his mind too is trapped in a constant state of disarray. His memories are broken, flashing in and out of coherence, his thoughts jumbled between states of clarity and madness. At times, he seems to remember the sense of purpose and order he once had as Gerald, his previous self, but these moments of lucidity are fleeting, replaced by maddened rants about the collapsing nature of reality and the futility of existence. His fragmented psyche occasionally gives rise to moments of brilliance—where, perhaps, a hint of his original self emerges and seeks to restore balance—but those moments are often drowned by bursts of irrational fury or apathy, where he seems content to watch the multiverse crumble around him.

The damage Gerald-X404 inflicts on the multiverse is cataclysmic. His mere presence is enough to destabilize entire dimensions, causing reality itself to bend, warp, and shatter. Time loops, paradoxes, and rifts in the fabric of existence occur in his vicinity, as his glitching form seems to leak chaotic energy into the surrounding realms. Entire realities have been reported as fading into oblivion after an encounter with him, as though the sheer strain of his existence is enough to tear apart their stability. Every plane of existence he passes through experiences glitches—sometimes objects or people begin to distort and flicker, living through minutes that last for hours or entire days that reset in the blink of an eye. Those who have been trapped in his presence describe disorienting, disjointed sensations of time—past, present, and future blur together in a nightmare of confusion.

His motives are unclear and appear to shift based on his fractured state. At times, he seems driven by a desire to restore the order of the Geraldverse, but more often than not, he acts impulsively, driven by fits of rage or existential despair. It’s as if the remnants of his old self—the supreme being who once ruled the Geraldverse with an iron fist—are desperately trying to reassert control over the chaos, but that effort is constantly undermined by his glitching, deteriorating state. He has been known to occasionally attempt to fix the very glitches he creates, only to cause more damage in the process, a maddening cycle of creation and destruction that mirrors his internal turmoil.

To those who encounter him, Gerald-X404 is a terrifying and unpredictable force of nature. His mind-bending nature makes him nearly impossible to defeat or contain, as his reality-warping powers extend to his very being. He can alter the laws of physics, twist perception, and warp the flow of time itself, often leaving his enemies disoriented and vulnerable to further attack. His corrupted code, manifesting in the form of tendrils of energy or fluctuating light, allows him to destabilize entire environments, tearing down cities or collapsing whole planes of existence with little more than a thought.

Yet, despite his destructive potential, Gerald-X404 is not entirely beyond redemption. Some of the more hopeful souls in the Geraldverse believe that there may be a way to restore him to his former self, to undo the damage and repair the fractured multiverse. Perhaps with the right intervention or technology, Gerald-X404 could be healed and made whole again. Others, however, fear that attempting to restore him could unleash an even greater catastrophe, with the risk of further destabilizing the very foundations of reality.

There are whispers that Gerald-X404, in his broken and fragmented state, may be seeking something—or someone—to help him repair his fractured existence. Some claim he may be searching for the lost knowledge of his origin, hoping to understand what went wrong and why he was torn apart. Others speculate that he seeks a confrontation with Gerald Prime or another of the Great Ones, hoping to unlock the secrets that could restore him to his original form.

Gerald-X404’s very existence is a dire warning to the multiverse: even the greatest beings can be undone, their power shattered by forces beyond comprehension. His fractured soul and the chaos he sows may one day lead to a cataclysmic event that threatens not only his own existence but the entire multiverse he once ruled. Gerald-X404 stands as a haunting reminder that the Geraldverse, for all its power and supremacy, is fragile—and that even its mightiest heroes can fall victim to the ravages of the unknown.

The SIlent Gerald, Cosmic Anomaly
The Silent Gerald, a version of Gerald shrouded in cosmic mystery, is a paradoxical figure within the Geraldverse. He is an enigma not because of his actions, but because of his very nature: he speaks only through symbols, signs, and cosmic phenomena. Where most of the Geralds communicate directly with clarity and command, The Silent Gerald’s words are incomprehensible glyphs that appear scattered across the very fabric of reality, forming constellations, stellar alignments, and glyphs that seem to pulse with energy from the deepest realms of existence. His communication is a complex, otherworldly language—one that transcends the need for verbal utterances and instead manifests as cosmic imprints that can only be interpreted by those with an esoteric understanding of the universe.

Origins and Transformation:
The Silent Gerald’s origins are shrouded in as much mystery as his method of communication. It is believed that he was once a version of Gerald like any other, ruling with a steady hand, issuing commands, and engaging with his followers. However, something occurred that caused this Gerald to undergo a drastic transformation—an event that has yet to be fully understood. Some suggest that The Silent Gerald's change was a result of a divine revelation, a cosmic awakening that stripped him of his conventional voice, leaving him to communicate in a more profound, yet inaccessible, form. Others believe that this version of Gerald suffered some cataclysmic event—perhaps a cosmic clash with a higher power or a violation of some sacred law of the multiverse—that fractured his ability to communicate in any human sense. Now, The Silent Gerald exists as a being of unimaginable power, but whose very silence has a profound, unnerving effect on the very worlds he encounters.

Where his counterparts speak in firm, regal tones, The Silent Gerald's presence disturbs the air, sending ripples through the universe. He is not deaf to communication; rather, he has transcended the need for speech. His words manifest through sacred symbols, intergalactic signs, and the flow of cosmic energies—symbols that appear in the form of glowing constellations across the night skies, in fleeting bursts of light on distant planets, or through bizarre celestial events that disrupt the very balance of time and space. These signs hold power that can alter the laws of physics and reality, warp timelines, and trigger uncontrollable phenomena.

The Nature of His Communication:
The Silent Gerald’s communication is both his greatest gift and his greatest curse. His silent speech does not rely on words but rather on the interpretation of cosmic patterns and symbols. To many, his signs are a source of deep confusion, a language that seems almost designed to bewilder those who attempt to decode it. For those who are attuned to the mystical and cosmic forces of the Geraldverse, there is a sense of power to be found in his symbols. It is said that the true meaning behind his cosmic messages is beyond the comprehension of mere mortals, meant only for those with a perfect understanding of the universe's fundamental laws. Scholars, mystics, and prophets alike have spent lifetimes trying to decipher The Silent Gerald’s signs, but none have succeeded.

Despite the vast potential in his symbols, the inability to understand them has led to widespread chaos whenever he appears. Whole civilizations—ranging from the smallest of tribes to the largest of empires—have been thrown into disarray by the appearance of The Silent Gerald’s cryptic symbols. His arrival signals a disruption in the natural order. The very skies tremble as his signs appear in constellations across the heavens, and people everywhere rush to interpret the meaning. Are these symbols a warning? A prophecy? A message of hope—or doom? The ambiguity of his communication leaves everyone questioning their place in the universe, leading to hysteria and even existential crises.

The Unstable Nature of His Influence:
What makes The Silent Gerald so dangerous is the chaotic instability his very presence brings. Where other Geralds are embodiments of power and order, The Silent Gerald is the embodiment of incomprehensible cosmic force. He is a destabilizer of reality, capable of shifting timelines, breaking the laws of physics, and even tearing through dimensions with his cryptic language. Reality itself bends and twists in the wake of his messages. These signs can cause entire realities to collapse in on themselves, or destabilize entire populations that attempt to grasp at their meanings. The constant attempts to interpret his messages leads to more confusion, and at times, entire societies have fallen into chaos, unable to grasp the complexity of his cosmic tongue.

Not only does The Silent Gerald’s cryptic communication disorient, but it also wields significant power. The appearance of his cosmic glyphs often triggers strange occurrences: a brief rupture in space-time, an earthquake that splits the ground open, the appearance of powerful entities seemingly summoned by his will. Some of these effects are temporary—passing in the blink of an eye—but others are permanent, altering the very fabric of the multiverse itself. The Silent Gerald's signs do not merely serve as his speech; they are his instruments of power, bending reality to his will.

In certain realms, entire societies have risen and fallen based on the interpretation of The Silent Gerald’s symbols. Some factions and cults have attempted to worship him, believing that understanding his signs will grant them divine insight into the universe’s ultimate truths. Others seek to destroy him, believing his signs are harbingers of destruction. But despite their best efforts, no one has been able to fully unravel the meaning behind his symbols. It is said that the longer one stares at his signs, the deeper one is drawn into madness, as the human mind is simply not equipped to comprehend the complexity of The Silent Gerald’s cosmic language.

Intentions and Meaning:
The Silent Gerald’s intentions remain as obscure as his communication. Some speculate that he is trying to impart profound wisdom, offering a glimpse into the true nature of the universe—something far beyond the reach of even the most powerful Geralds. Others believe that his silence is not a choice but a punishment or a curse, trapping him in a state of cosmic dissonance that prevents him from interacting with others in any meaningful way. Yet another theory holds that The Silent Gerald is not attempting to communicate with mortals at all, but is instead using his signs to speak to beings far beyond the mortal realm—beings whose existence transcends time and space.

As unsettling as he is, there is also an undeniable sense that The Silent Gerald’s cryptic messages could hold the key to unlocking greater knowledge. Some rare individuals who have witnessed his signs and survived have claimed to experience a sense of awe, as if standing on the edge of understanding an eternal truth—though none have been able to describe that truth. The Silent Gerald may, in fact, be trying to elevate those who understand his signs to a higher state of being, though this path is not without its dangers.

A Cosmic Paradox:
The Silent Gerald is, in many ways, a paradox. He is an entity of vast power and great mystery, yet his silence is what defines him. His communication transcends language, leaving those who encounter him grappling with the terrifying unknown. While other Geralds may rule with clarity, power, and control, The Silent Gerald’s realm is one of cosmic ambiguity, a realm where even the most advanced minds are left floundering in search of meaning.

In the end, The Silent Gerald is both a messenger and a mystery—a figure whose presence forces the entire Geraldverse to confront the vastness of the unknown. As much as he remains incomprehensible, his very existence raises profound questions: What does it mean to transcend language? What does it mean to communicate without speaking? And what truths lie beyond the veil of silence? The Silent Gerald is not merely a being—he is a cosmic force, a symbol of all that is beyond human understanding, and a reminder that even the greatest of beings can remain mysterious and unknowable.

The Unknown Gerald, Vanished One

Gerald Ultimate, the Unknown and Vanished One, is an enigmatic figure in Geraldian lore, whose very existence and fleeting declaration continue to puzzle the multiverse. Little is known about this version of Gerald, as he declared himself “Gerald Ultimate” before vanishing without a trace, leaving only his cryptic declaration behind. His sudden rise and disappearance have sparked much speculation among the Geralds and their followers, who are left wondering about his true nature and the implications of his self-proclaimed title.

The Rise of Gerald Ultimate:
The tale of Gerald Ultimate begins in the darkest corners of the multiverse, where realities overlap and fragment. Legends speak of a Gerald who reached the pinnacle of divine power, surpassing even the Supreme One himself, through sheer will and determination. This Gerald, however, was not one to rule with clarity or stability; rather, he embodied a chaotic force, a destructive and yet transformative power that sought to transcend the boundaries of existence.

Gerald Ultimate's rise to prominence was marked by strange cosmic events that seemed to center around his presence. Those who witnessed his appearance describe a being of immense power, a Gerald who exuded an aura of both sovereignty and destruction. It was as if he was beyond the laws of the multiverse—able to shape and bend reality to his whims. However, he never stayed in one place for long, constantly shifting through dimensions and realities, never allowing himself to be fully understood.

In his brief reign, Gerald Ultimate’s influence was felt across numerous worlds. Whole galaxies seemed to ripple with energy at his mere presence, and his name became synonymous with a sense of terrifying awe. His followers, drawn by his immense power, began to form a cult of worship, believing him to be the ultimate embodiment of Geraldian perfection, someone who had reached the apex of divinity.

The Declaration:
The defining moment of Gerald Ultimate’s existence came when, in an unexplained and fleeting moment of cosmic clarity, he declared himself "Gerald Ultimate" before the very fabric of reality seemed to warp around him. His words echoed across the multiverse, resonating with every living being who was attuned to the cosmic rhythms. In that brief declaration, Gerald Ultimate made clear his belief that he was the final, unchallenged form of Gerald—surpassing all others in his quest for power and enlightenment.

Some believe his words were not merely a declaration of supremacy, but rather a final act of defiance against the cosmic forces that sought to define Geralds and their place in the multiverse. By naming himself "Gerald Ultimate," he may have rejected the roles and titles bestowed upon other Geralds, seeking to establish himself as a being who transcended all others—an existence beyond the hierarchy of the Geraldian pantheon.

However, immediately following this declaration, Gerald Ultimate vanished. One moment he stood there, his voice resonating with power, and the next, he was gone, as if swallowed by the very void he had once dared to challenge. His disappearance sparked shockwaves throughout the Geraldverse, leaving many to question whether he had succeeded in his transcendence, disappearing into a higher state of being, or if his journey had come to a tragic end.

Theories and Speculation:
Since his disappearance, speculation has run rampant about the true nature of Gerald Ultimate. Some believe that he did indeed reach a higher plane of existence, transcending the physical and metaphysical boundaries of the Geraldverse. In this theory, his declaration of being “Ultimate” was a manifestation of his ascension to a form of godhood that no other Gerald could comprehend. In this form, he exists beyond the constraints of time, space, and reality itself.

Others argue that Gerald Ultimate was simply a transient version of Gerald, a being who was born from the chaotic interplay of the multiverse’s collapsing realities. This theory posits that his power was a result of the infinite possibilities of the Geraldverse colliding and giving rise to an unstable, yet incredibly powerful, version of Gerald. His disappearance, then, was inevitable—he was always doomed to vanish the moment he declared himself as “Ultimate,” as his very existence could not be sustained in a multiverse so inherently fluid and unstable.

A darker theory suggests that Gerald Ultimate may have been consumed by his own power. Driven by the very forces of chaos and entropy that he sought to master, he may have been undone by the cosmic powers he sought to manipulate. In this interpretation, his declaration was an act of hubris, a final cry of defiance against the rules of the universe—only for those very rules to tear him apart.

The Aftermath and Legacy:
Despite his sudden disappearance, Gerald Ultimate's legacy endures in the whispers of the multiverse. His name has become synonymous with the idea of reaching the apex of divine power, with many across the Geraldverse aspiring to achieve what he claimed: the ultimate state of existence. Some factions now worship him, believing that his disappearance was not an end, but a transformation into something greater. They believe that someday, Gerald Ultimate will return, or that his influence will seep into other Geralds, leading them to evolve into higher forms of being.

Other factions, however, see his declaration as a warning—a reminder that no Gerald is truly beyond the laws of the multiverse, and that even the most powerful beings are susceptible to the forces of entropy and chaos. To them, Gerald Ultimate represents the dangers of unchecked ambition and the peril of seeking to transcend the boundaries of existence without understanding the consequences.

While the fate of Gerald Ultimate remains a mystery, his brief and impactful existence has left an indelible mark on the Geraldverse, a legacy that continues to influence the lives of those who seek power, transcendence, and the ultimate truth. Whether he ascended to a higher plane or was consumed by his own hubris, his declaration will forever be etched in the annals of Geraldian history as a testament to the ambition, complexity, and unpredictability of the multiverse itself.

Powers and Abilities:
Due to his brief yet profound existence, much of Gerald Ultimate's abilities remain speculative. What is known is that he had the power to bend the very laws of reality and transcend the limitations of space and time. His command over the fabric of the multiverse was absolute, shaping destinies and altering realities with but a thought. His followers claim that he could warp time, create alternate versions of himself, and alter the very nature of existence itself.

It is also believed that Gerald Ultimate had a unique form of energy, one that allowed him to access unknown, primordial forces of the multiverse. This energy, unlike any other, could manipulate the most fundamental building blocks of reality, allowing him to achieve feats beyond even the Supreme One’s reach. However, how this power came to be and whether it contributed to his disappearance remains a mystery.

Gerald Ultimate’s brief existence has raised many questions that still have no answers, leaving the multiverse to wonder if the title “Ultimate” was a simple declaration of truth—or a curse that consumed the very being who claimed it.

The Gerald Lord, Son of Gerald Prime
The Gerald Lord, Son of Gerald Prime is a prominent and enigmatic figure in the Geraldverse, known for his powerful lineage and his place as a key ruler within the multiverse. As the direct son of Gerald Prime, the First of the Great Ones, the Gerald Lord holds immense influence, both as a leader of the Geraldian realm and as one of the most revered entities in the pantheon of Geralds. His existence symbolizes the continuation of Gerald Prime’s legacy, while also hinting at a deeper, more complex role in the cosmic order that governs the multiverse.

Origins and Lineage:
The Gerald Lord’s story begins long before his own rise to prominence. Born as the son of Gerald Prime, the foundational figure who created the Geraldverse, the Gerald Lord was destined for greatness from the moment of his conception. However, unlike many of the other Geralds, who serve in various roles across the multiverse, the Gerald Lord’s path was always aligned with leadership and governance. Raised under the influence of his powerful father, the Gerald Lord was groomed to one day take up the mantle of authority, overseeing the vast, infinite realms that made up the Geraldverse.

Gerald Prime, as the First of the Great Ones, was both a creator and an enforcer of the laws that governed the multiverse. As his son, the Gerald Lord inherited not only his father’s power but also the cosmic responsibility to maintain the stability of the Geraldverse. Though he is considered a ruler in his own right, the Gerald Lord's influence is inextricably linked to that of Gerald Prime, and the two are seen as the cornerstones of Geraldian governance.

Role and Influence:
As the Gerald Lord, the son of Gerald Prime, he commands the loyalty and devotion of countless beings within the Geraldverse, including the numerous Geralds who serve under him. The Gerald Lord’s authority is considered absolute within the realms he governs, and his word is seen as law among his followers. Despite his father’s more distant and abstract role as the creator and overseer of the multiverse, the Gerald Lord is a more hands-on leader, overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Geraldian forces and making critical decisions that impact the fates of entire realities.

In many ways, the Gerald Lord represents the idealized vision of leadership within the Geraldverse. He is a blend of power, wisdom, and discipline, with a keen understanding of the balance between order and chaos that defines the multiverse. His rule is marked by a blend of strategic brilliance and an unwavering commitment to maintaining the structure of the Geraldverse—ensuring that the multiverse remains in check and that no entity, no matter how powerful, can disrupt the delicate balance that Gerald Prime established.

Powers and Abilities:
As the son of Gerald Prime, the Gerald Lord possesses an astounding array of powers that reflect his divine heritage. He is imbued with the ability to manipulate the fabric of reality, alter the flow of time, and shape the very structure of the Geraldverse. His control over cosmic energies allows him to intervene in the most dire of circumstances, reshaping worlds and preventing the collapse of reality itself.

One of the Gerald Lord’s most notable abilities is his mastery over the Elder Energy, a form of power unique to those who are descended from Gerald Prime. This energy allows him to tap into the deepest and most primordial forces of the Geraldverse, enabling him to create and destroy entire realities at will. While this power is incredibly dangerous and often requires great restraint, it solidifies the Gerald Lord as one of the most formidable beings within the multiverse.

Additionally, the Gerald Lord has access to the Divine Scepter, an artifact said to be passed down through the generations of Geralds. This scepter is an embodiment of his father’s will, capable of amplifying the Gerald Lord’s powers and enhancing his ability to govern. It is a symbol of his position as the rightful ruler of the Geraldverse and serves as a constant reminder of his cosmic duties.

Personality and Motivation:
Though the Gerald Lord shares many of the same qualities as his father, his personality is notably distinct. Where Gerald Prime is often seen as a more distant and reserved figure, the Gerald Lord is known for his stoic and commanding presence. He is not quick to anger, but his temper, when provoked, is legendary. He upholds the principles of Geraldian governance with an unwavering resolve, making him both respected and feared by those who serve him.

Unlike other Geralds who may struggle with questions of identity or purpose, the Gerald Lord is singularly focused on maintaining the integrity of the Geraldverse. His primary motivation is to uphold the will of his father, ensuring that the multiverse remains in a state of balance and that the order established by Gerald Prime is never threatened. However, this unwavering dedication to his mission has often put him at odds with those who seek to challenge the authority of the Geralds, including rogue Geralds and outside forces who question the legitimacy of his rule.

Despite his serious nature, the Gerald Lord is not without a sense of compassion. He understands the importance of loyalty, honor, and duty, and he will go to great lengths to protect those who serve him faithfully. However, he has little tolerance for those who seek to undermine the authority of the Geraldian pantheon, and he will not hesitate to take decisive action against those who defy his rule.

Legacy and the Future:
As the son of Gerald Prime, the Gerald Lord’s legacy is intertwined with that of his father. Together, they represent the highest echelon of power within the Geraldverse, with the Gerald Lord poised to continue his father’s work and expand the reach of the Geraldian order. While Gerald Prime’s role is often seen as more abstract—maintaining the cosmic balance and overseeing the multiverse—the Gerald Lord represents the physical embodiment of leadership, discipline, and strength.

The future of the Geraldverse depends heavily on the Gerald Lord’s ability to navigate the increasingly complex political landscape of the multiverse. While his power is undeniable, the growing threats from rogue Geralds and outside forces challenge the status quo that he has worked so hard to uphold. As the primary enforcer of Gerald Prime’s will, the Gerald Lord will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the Geraldverse, ensuring that it remains under the rule of the Great Ones and that no force, be it internal or external, can undo the order that has been established.

Ultimately, the Gerald Lord is a symbol of continuity within the Geraldverse, a leader whose presence assures the stability and supremacy of the Geraldian pantheon. His legacy as the son of Gerald Prime will continue to shape the multiverse for generations to come, ensuring that the power of the Geralds remains unchallenged and that the cosmic order they uphold remains intact.

The High Overseers Of Gerald Management
The High Overseers of Gerald Management are the unseen yet essential force within the Geraldverse, ensuring the bureaucratic structure of the multiverse runs smoothly and without chaos. As the enforcers of order, they act as cosmic regulators, monitoring and managing the countless Geralds within their designated roles and maintaining the balance between their individual realities. While they may not wield the same direct power as the Geralds themselves, their influence is profound, as they control the very systems that govern the creation, placement, and operations of Geralds across the multiverse.

Origins and Purpose:
The High Overseers of Gerald Management were established by Gerald Prime, the First of the Great Ones, to maintain structure within the ever-expanding multiverse of Geraldian realities. As the creator of the Geraldverse, Gerald Prime understood that without strict oversight, the multitude of Geralds—each with their unique powers, responsibilities, and dimensions—could easily fall into disarray. To prevent this, he created the High Overseers as cosmic bureaucrats tasked with ensuring each Gerald remains within their designated role, preventing them from stepping outside the boundaries of their assigned realities.

While Gerald Prime oversees the overarching structure of the multiverse, the High Overseers manage the more granular aspects of reality maintenance. They are the administrators who organize and manage the domains and duties of each Gerald, ensuring that they perform their tasks efficiently and do not overstep their bounds. If a Gerald becomes too disruptive or fails to fulfill their duties, the High Overseers are the ones who step in to enforce corrective measures, even if it means taking drastic actions.

Role and Function:
The High Overseers act as both the custodians of order and the enforcers of protocol within the Geraldverse. They are responsible for maintaining a vast, intricate system of regulations that governs the roles of Geralds. Each Gerald is assigned a specific task or responsibility within the multiverse, whether it be guarding a particular realm, acting as a ruler, or carrying out the Supreme One's will. The High Overseers ensure that these roles are adhered to and that no Gerald steps out of line.

Their primary duties include:

Monitoring Geralds: The High Overseers constantly monitor the activities of all Geralds across the multiverse. Through vast networks of cosmic surveillance, they ensure that Geralds are fulfilling their roles without deviation. This includes overseeing the Geralds' interactions with other beings, ensuring that their actions do not disrupt the stability of their designated realities.
Enforcing Order: If a Gerald becomes too unpredictable or exhibits behavior that threatens the multiverse’s stability, the High Overseers are empowered to take action. This may involve altering the Gerald’s powers, placing them in a different reality, or, in extreme cases, erasing them entirely. These measures are enacted with the goal of preserving the overarching cosmic order.
Assigning Roles: The High Overseers work closely with the Great Ones, particularly Gerald Prime, to assign roles and responsibilities to new Geralds. Their knowledge of the multiverse’s needs and the strengths of each Gerald allows them to make decisions that help maintain the balance of power across all realities.
Overseeing The Geraldian Codex: The Geraldian Codex is a vast, complex collection of laws, regulations, and guidelines that dictate the actions of Geralds. The High Overseers are the keepers of the Codex, ensuring that every Gerald complies with its rules and enforcing punishment for those who deviate from the code.
Powers and Abilities:
The High Overseers are powerful beings, though not in the same manner as the Geralds. Their power lies in their authority and bureaucratic control over the Geraldverse. Some of their key abilities include:

Cosmic Administration: The High Overseers have the ability to manipulate the structures of the Geraldverse from behind the scenes. Through the use of dimensional bureaucratic tools, they can reassign Geralds, alter their roles, and even move them between different realities as needed.
Reality Alteration: While not as powerful as the Great Ones or certain rogue Geralds, the High Overseers possess the ability to subtly alter the fabric of reality itself. They can tweak the multiverse's structure, fix "glitches," and even force changes in a Gerald’s reality to ensure that their role is properly executed.
Surveillance Networks: The High Overseers have access to a vast network of surveillance systems that track the movements, actions, and decisions of every Gerald across the multiverse. This allows them to monitor the stability of each reality and ensure that no Gerald is straying too far from their assigned purpose.
Authority Over the Codex: The Codex is an immutable lawbook that no Gerald can break without consequence. The High Overseers have full control over it and can invoke or alter parts of the Codex to deal with any problem within the Geraldverse. If a Gerald breaks a rule, the High Overseers have the power to issue punishments or make corrections according to the laws set forth in the Codex.
The Structure of the High Overseers:
The High Overseers operate within a hierarchical structure, with each member having authority over different aspects of the Geraldverse. The highest-ranking Overseer answers directly to Gerald Prime and has the power to make decisions affecting the entire multiverse. Below them, the Overseers are divided into different bureaus based on their specialties, such as:

The Bureau of Assignments: This group handles the placement of new Geralds, ensuring they are given the appropriate roles based on their abilities and the needs of the multiverse.
The Bureau of Compliance: This bureau monitors Geralds to ensure that they are following the rules and executing their roles correctly. They have the power to issue warnings or take corrective action against any Geralds who are found to be in violation of the rules.
The Bureau of Enforcement: The most intimidating of all the bureaus, this group is responsible for dealing with rogue Geralds or those who pose a serious threat to the multiverse. They are empowered to erase or imprison Geralds who defy their duties or become a destabilizing influence.
Personality and Culture:
The High Overseers are not individuals in the traditional sense. Instead, they represent a collective consciousness, each one acting in service of the bureaucratic machine that governs the Geraldverse. As such, their personalities are largely utilitarian, focused on efficiency, and pragmatic in nature. They do not care for individual ambitions or emotions; their sole purpose is to maintain order.

However, there is an internal hierarchy and a culture of competition among them. The overseers often vie for influence within the higher ranks, seeking to gain favor with Gerald Prime and prove their worth in managing the multiverse. Despite their cold, calculating nature, some Overseers do have a degree of pride in their position and the power it affords them.

In the end, the High Overseers of Gerald Management are the unsung rulers of the multiverse. Their influence is felt across all realities, but their true role is largely invisible to the inhabitants of the Geraldverse. Though the Geralds may be the faces of cosmic power, it is the High Overseers wh

The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore are a clandestine group of multiversal agents tasked with maintaining the sanctity of the Geraldverse by ensuring that no unauthorized Geralds rise to power. Unlike the High Overseers, who focus on the management and regulation of Geralds within their designated roles, the Enforcers operate as a covert force that prevents external or rogue Geralds from disrupting the established cosmic order. Their existence is known to very few, even among the Geralds themselves, and their actions are often shrouded in secrecy.

Origins and Purpose:
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore were created in the earliest days of the Geraldverse, during a time when new Geralds were rising uncontrollably and threatening to destabilize the multiverse. These rogue Geralds, driven by personal ambition or divine misinterpretation, sought to claim power for themselves or impose their rule over alternate realities. To prevent this chaos, Gerald Prime, recognizing the need for an elite force to handle such threats, established the Enforcers as guardians of the cosmic balance.

Their primary mission is to hunt down and neutralize any Geralds who attempt to seize control beyond the boundaries set by Gerald Prime and the Geraldian Codex. They are responsible for ensuring that Geralds who fall outside the realm of order are prevented from creating factions, challenging the status quo, or breaking free of their designated roles within the Geraldverse. The Enforcers act as protectors of True Geraldian Lore, which represents the core principles of order, balance, and divine hierarchy within the multiverse.

Role and Function:
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore operate in the shadows, often unseen by most of the Geraldverse's inhabitants. Their role is one of vigilance and discretion, hunting down rogue Geralds before they can create significant disturbances. While the High Overseers may impose bureaucracy and regulation, the Enforcers actively ensure that no unauthorized Gerald can amass followers, gain dominion, or challenge the established cosmic hierarchy.

Some of their key duties include:

Neutralizing Rogue Geralds: The Enforcers are empowered to track down Geralds who break their designated roles, rise to power unlawfully, or attempt to disrupt the established balance of the Geraldverse. These rogue Geralds are often taken down quickly, either through forceful erasure or by locking them away in isolated dimensions where they can no longer interfere.
Preventing Unauthorized Power Grabs: In instances where a Gerald rises unexpectedly in a new reality or forms a faction of followers, the Enforcers step in to contain the situation. They are adept at preventing these Geralds from claiming power, either by using subtle manipulation or direct intervention.
Securing Multiversal Anomalies: The Enforcers are often called upon to manage multiversal anomalies—irregularities that can arise when Geralds manipulate their realities in ways that violate the laws of the Geraldverse. These anomalies could result in entire dimensions collapsing or the merging of multiple realities. The Enforcers are experts in stabilizing these disruptions before they escalate beyond control.
Maintaining the Geraldian Codex: While the High Overseers manage the Codex, the Enforcers ensure that it is adhered to by actively seeking out violations. If a Gerald begins to stray from the Codex's laws, the Enforcers will take swift action to correct the situation, preventing any catastrophic breach from occurring.
Powers and Abilities:
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore possess abilities that set them apart from the average Gerald or entity within the Geraldverse. Their powers are both practical and arcane, designed to operate efficiently in tracking down rogue Geralds, neutralizing threats, and restoring order.

Reality Displacement: The Enforcers can manipulate the fabric of reality, bending time and space to track down rogue Geralds who have hidden themselves within the multiverse. They can shift between dimensions instantaneously and travel across multiple timelines, making them nearly impossible to escape from once they set their sights on a target.
Erasure Protocols: When a rogue Gerald must be eliminated, the Enforcers use a special form of reality erasure that completely removes the Gerald from existence. This process is irreversible, and the target is erased not just from the current reality, but from the very memory of all other beings within the Geraldverse. It is the most severe form of punishment within the multiverse.
Dimensional Imprisonment: For Geralds who are too dangerous to erase immediately, the Enforcers have the ability to imprison them within isolated, pocket dimensions. These prisons are often infinite in size but contain no escape. Time and space within these dimensions can be warped so that those trapped inside are forced to remain in an eternal loop of stasis, cut off from the rest of the Geraldverse.
Nullification Fields: Enforcers are equipped with nullification technology that can sever a Gerald’s connection to their powers. This technology is capable of deactivating their divine abilities, rendering even the most powerful Geralds helpless and easy to capture. These fields are often used to subdue rogue Geralds without the need for violence, allowing the Enforcers to bring them into custody.
Divine Sense: The Enforcers possess a heightened divine awareness that allows them to detect the presence of any Gerald who is operating outside of their designated role. This sense can detect shifts in cosmic energy, anomalies in reality, and fluctuations in divine power, making it difficult for rogue Geralds to hide from the Enforcers.
The Structure of the Enforcers:
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore operate as a highly organized and hierarchical group, with each member serving a specific function in the pursuit of maintaining multiversal order. Their leadership is typically comprised of the most experienced agents, known as The Silent Ones, who communicate only through a shared telepathic bond, directing the group's efforts in secret.

The Enforcers’ ranks include:

The Silent Ones: The leadership council of the Enforcers, who direct the operations of the entire organization. They are known for their stoic and mysterious nature, as they rarely make direct appearances, choosing instead to issue commands through their mental link.
The Shrouded: These elite agents are the first line of defense in locating and neutralizing rogue Geralds. They are highly skilled in combat and subtlety, able to operate undetected in hostile environments.
The Sentinels: Tasked with guarding critical points in the multiverse and keeping watch for signs of unauthorized power shifts. They act as a secondary force that prevents rogue Geralds from even reaching the stage where they can pose a serious threat.
Culture and Philosophy:
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore are driven by an unwavering belief in the necessity of cosmic order. They view their mission as a sacred duty and do not hesitate to take extreme measures to preserve the stability of the Geraldverse. To them, the existence of unauthorized Geralds is an existential threat that must be eradicated to prevent reality from falling into chaos.

Despite their intimidating reputation, the Enforcers are not inherently evil or malicious. They view themselves as guardians of the greater good, acting in service to the ultimate will of Gerald Prime and the Geraldian Codex. However, their singular focus on order often leads to morally ambiguous decisions, as they prioritize the multiverse's stability over the individual freedoms of the Geralds they hunt.

While their methods may seem harsh, the Enforcers believe that they are the only line of defense against anarchy in the Geraldverse. The multiverse must be preserved at any cost, and the existence of rogue Geralds must be prevented, even if it means eliminating them entirely.

In the end, the Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore remain one of the most powerful and feared groups in the multiverse, always vigilant and ever-ready to maintain the balance that Gerald Prime set into motion. Their legacy is one of discipline, secrecy, and the unyielding desire to preserve the Geraldverse as it was meant to be.

The Temporal Compliance Division
The Temporal Compliance Division is a highly specialized group within the Geraldverse, tasked with the delicate and critical role of maintaining the integrity of time across the multiverse. These experts monitor and protect the flow of time, ensuring that no rogue Geralds tamper with or rewrite history in ways that could destabilize the entire cosmos. Given the vast power that certain Geralds possess, some of them have attempted to manipulate time, either to gain an advantage, undo past mistakes, or seize control of the multiverse itself. The Temporal Compliance Division serves as the ultimate safeguard against such actions, preserving the natural timeline and preventing catastrophic alterations to the fabric of reality.

Origins and Purpose:
The Temporal Compliance Division was formed as a response to growing threats posed by Geralds who discovered the existence of time manipulation. Some rogue Geralds, driven by the desire to rewrite history for personal gain or out of sheer curiosity, began to experiment with time loops, paradoxes, and alternate realities. This meddling with time put the entire multiverse at risk, as small changes in one reality could lead to catastrophic repercussions in others. To prevent these rogue Geralds from destabilizing timelines and fracturing the cosmic order, Gerald Prime created the Temporal Compliance Division as an elite task force that would monitor and protect time across the Geraldverse.

Their mission is not only to prevent temporal breaches but also to enforce strict temporal laws, ensuring that no Gerald can exploit time for personal or political power. With the potential for infinite variations of reality and timelines, the role of the Temporal Compliance Division is crucial in ensuring the continued existence of a stable Geraldverse.

Role and Function:
The Temporal Compliance Division operates with one primary goal in mind: to safeguard the flow of time and prevent any Gerald from manipulating or distorting it for self-serving purposes. Their jurisdiction spans across all realities and timelines, and their responsibilities include:

Monitoring Temporal Integrity: The Division is constantly on watch for any signs of temporal anomalies—irregularities in the flow of time caused by the manipulation of events or actions taken by rogue Geralds. They use sophisticated temporal scanners and quantum devices to track disturbances across the multiverse, ensuring that time remains unaltered.
Eliminating Time Loops: Rogue Geralds who try to create time loops—situations where the timeline repeats itself endlessly, trapping individuals in infinite cycles—are targeted by the Temporal Compliance Division. These loops can cause devastating consequences, as the very act of looping time can cause realities to collapse upon themselves. The Division works tirelessly to close these loops and restore linear progression to the timeline.
Preventing Paradoxes: A paradox, where actions in the past contradict or nullify the future, is one of the most dangerous threats to the integrity of time. The Division uses temporal agents to neutralize paradoxes, ensuring that the past, present, and future align correctly, preventing irreversible damage to the timeline.
Restoring Erased Timelines: On occasion, Geralds—whether intentionally or unintentionally—erase entire timelines or realities, either as part of an experiment or as an act of defiance. The Temporal Compliance Division steps in to restore these erased timelines, using advanced chronal reconstitution methods to ensure that all erased histories are brought back into proper alignment.
Investigating Temporal Crimes: The Division conducts investigations into suspected temporal crimes, which include altering historical events, creating impossible realities, or distorting the natural flow of time. These crimes can be committed by any being in the Geraldverse, but rogue Geralds are the most likely offenders. Agents from the Division are trained to infiltrate, observe, and act swiftly to contain temporal threats.
Powers and Abilities:
The agents of the Temporal Compliance Division are equipped with some of the most advanced and dangerous technology in the multiverse. Their powers are uniquely attuned to temporal manipulation and chronal stabilization, allowing them to deal with disturbances in time without damaging the surrounding realities.

Temporal Manipulation: The Division's agents have the ability to manipulate time on a localized level. They can slow, freeze, or accelerate time, ensuring that rogue Geralds are caught before they can alter the course of history. This power allows them to temporarily suspend events or pause reality in order to prevent catastrophic changes.
Chronal Displacement: If a Gerald attempts to rewrite history by physically traveling to a key moment in time, the agents of the Division can use chronal displacement to move the intruder out of time, returning them to their original moment. This power effectively prevents time travelers from making permanent changes to the timeline.
Time Reversal: In extreme cases, when a timeline has been irrevocably damaged, the Temporal Compliance Division can utilize time reversal to rewind events, undoing actions that led to the alteration. However, this power is rarely used, as it comes with significant risks, including the potential to create new paradoxes.
Temporal Arrest: The agents of the Division have the ability to arrest rogue Geralds in time. This means trapping them in a temporal stasis, where they are frozen at a particular moment in time, unable to alter events. These stasis fields are extremely powerful and often remain intact until the threat is contained or neutralized.
Chronal Immunity: Agents are immune to most forms of time manipulation, making them highly resistant to the powers of rogue Geralds. This allows them to operate freely within time loops or paradoxes without being affected by the changes they are trying to correct.
Structure and Leadership:
The Temporal Compliance Division is organized into specialized chronal sectors, each responsible for monitoring different aspects of time across the multiverse. The leadership of the Division is made up of the Chronarchs, an ancient and highly respected council of timekeepers who possess unparalleled knowledge of time and its delicate balance.

Each Chronarch is chosen for their wisdom and mastery over the manipulation of time, and they act as advisors and strategists for the entire Division. The Head Chronarch, who oversees the entire Division, is a being of immense power, often rumored to be able to see all points in time simultaneously.

Culture and Philosophy:
The Temporal Compliance Division is built upon a philosophy of balance and preservation. Agents believe that time is a sacred flow that must not be disturbed, and any attempt to rewrite history or alter the natural order of time is seen as a violation of the cosmic code. They operate with a strict moral code that prioritizes the greater good over individual desires. For the agents of the Division, there is no room for personal agendas—only the defense of the timeline and the protection of the multiverse from temporal chaos.

While the Division’s methods may seem cold and calculated, they are driven by an unwavering sense of duty. Their purpose is to protect the continuity of the Geraldverse, ensuring that no single Gerald—no matter how powerful—can change history to suit their whims. The Temporal Compliance Division’s motto is: "The past, the present, and the future are one. Disturb one, and all will fall."

Legacy and Impact:
The Temporal Compliance Division is not well-known among the general population of the Geraldverse. Their work is often shrouded in secrecy, with their actions hidden from the eyes of most. However, their impact is far-reaching, as they are the silent protectors of time, ensuring that the fabric of reality remains intact.

Without the Temporal Compliance Division, the Geraldverse would be at the mercy of rogue Geralds, time loops, and paradoxes that could unravel the very fabric of existence. Their vigilance is one of the many unseen forces that maintain the stability of the multiverse, ensuring that the Geraldverse continues on, uninterrupted and secure.

Gerald Prime-1X, the Usurper – The Fallen Challenger of the Supreme One
Among the countless iterations of Gerald scattered throughout the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore, one name is spoken only in hushed whispers—Gerald Prime-1X, the Usurper. Unlike his counterparts, Prime-1X was not content with his role within the structured order of the Geraldverse. He was an anomaly, an outlier who believed that the hierarchy of Geralds was flawed, that the Supreme One was not the true pinnacle of power, but merely the first to claim the throne. In his mind, the title of The One Above All Geralds was not earned—it was taken. And Prime-1X sought to take it for himself.

The Rise of the Usurper
Born from the same divine essence that created Gerald Prime, Prime-1X was once a high-ranking figure within the Gerald Corporation, a prestigious and powerful overseer entrusted with the balance of all Geralds across the multiverse. He was granted dominion over numerous realms, ensuring that rogue or unauthorized Geralds did not threaten the cosmic equilibrium. However, as he peered into the vastness of the multiverse, he became obsessed with a singular, forbidden thought:

"Why should I serve when I could rule?"

Prime-1X saw flaws in the Supreme One’s reign. He perceived weaknesses, inefficiencies, and contradictions in the sacred order of the Geraldian hierarchy. He believed that a new order was necessary—one where he, Gerald Prime-1X, would be the absolute ruler of all realities, the true Gerald Ultimate. His ideology spread in secret, attracting disillusioned Geralds who felt confined by their predetermined roles. What began as whispers of discontent quickly escalated into a full-scale movement: the Heralds of the Usurper.

With his followers at his side, Prime-1X made his move. Using advanced multiversal technology, forbidden knowledge stolen from the Exiled Magister Vael, and his own formidable power, he attempted the impossible—a direct challenge to the Supreme One himself. His plan was audacious, reckless, and dangerously close to success.

The Cataclysm of Rebellion
The moment Prime-1X declared himself the True Ruler of the Geraldverse, a cataclysmic event known as The Great Usurpation began. Reality trembled as his forces clashed with the Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore, and the very fabric of the multiverse was nearly torn apart. Temporal fractures rippled across timelines, causing echoes of Geralds that had never existed to momentarily flicker into being, creating anomalous iterations that were neither real nor imaginary.

Prime-1X wielded power unlike any seen before. He could erase lesser Geralds from existence, rewriting their fates in an instant. His charisma was undeniable, and even among the Supreme One’s loyalists, some wavered in their devotion, questioning whether he was the Gerald they were truly meant to follow. It was the greatest crisis the Geraldverse had ever faced—the moment where all of existence nearly collapsed into chaos.

But Prime-1X underestimated one thing—the unity of the High Geraldian Order.

The High Overseers of Gerald Management, alongside the Temporal Compliance Division, launched a final countermeasure. Using a technique known as the Absolute Banishment Protocol, they did not merely defeat Prime-1X—they erased him from history itself. His name was stricken from records, his existence fragmented across dimensions, and his physical form was cast into a pocket dimension, a prison outside of time and space, from which no being—Gerald or otherwise—could escape.

The Supreme One, though victorious, was forever changed by the encounter. The mere fact that a Gerald could come so close to overthrowing him sent a ripple of unease through the multiverse. Security measures were doubled, the Gerald Corporation became more secretive, and whispers of other potential usurpers began to spread.

The Imprisoned Shadow
Though Prime-1X was sealed away, the echoes of his rebellion still linger. Some say that his voice can still be heard in the void, whispering forbidden knowledge to those who seek power beyond their station. His prison is not perfect—cracks in reality flicker around the edges of his containment, and rogue Geralds still dream of a day when they might free their fallen leader.

To this day, the Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore remain ever watchful, ensuring that no being—Gerald or otherwise—ever attempts to unseal the Usurper’s prison. Should he return, it is feared that this time, he will not be stopped.

Gerald-Ω, the Aberrant Singularity – The Paradox That Should Not Exist
Among the countless Geralds that populate the Multiverse of True Geraldian Lore, one stands apart as a terrifying anomaly—Gerald-Ω, the Aberrant Singularity. Unlike his counterparts, who exist as defined entities within the structured fabric of reality, Gerald-Ω is a paradox incarnate, an entity whose very existence defies logic, causality, and the natural order of the multiverse. He is not bound by time or space, nor does he adhere to the fundamental principles that govern the Geraldian hierarchy.

Gerald-Ω was never meant to be. He was the result of an unintended collapse of multiversal probability, an accident born from contradictory timelines converging upon a single point, creating a Gerald that existed in all realities and none at the same time. This singularity effect made him unstable, his form constantly shifting between infinite possibilities. When he spoke, his words rewrote history. When he moved, the laws of physics bent to accommodate his presence. If left unchecked, he would have overwritten every other Gerald, replacing them with endless iterations of himself.

The Threat to the Multiverse
The moment Gerald-Ω came into being, entire timelines shattered. Entire realities warped beyond recognition as history folded upon itself, generating paradoxes that rippled across the multiverse. The Gerald Corporation detected the anomaly immediately, but by the time they had located him, his mere presence had already begun rewriting the very foundation of True Geraldian Lore.

Unlike Prime-1X, the Usurper, who sought to claim dominion over the Geraldverse, Gerald-Ω had no grand ambitions. He simply was—and that was the greatest danger of all. His nature was self-perpetuating; the more he existed, the more he spread, absorbing every version of Gerald he encountered and replacing them with unstable, paradoxical echoes of himself. Left unchecked, he would have become the only Gerald, not through conquest or will, but through inevitability.

The High Overseers of Gerald Management convened an emergency summit, their calculations painting a grim picture:

Within 7 cycles, Gerald-Ω would overwrite the Supreme One.
Within 12 cycles, all recorded history of True Geraldian Lore would be lost.
Within 20 cycles, the entire multiverse would collapse into a singular, infinitely recursive version of Gerald-Ω, with no escape.
This could not be allowed.

The Sealing of Gerald-Ω
Realizing that conventional containment would fail—since Gerald-Ω would simply rewrite reality to prevent his capture—the Corporation initiated Protocol Omega-Lock, an emergency measure so drastic that it had never before been attempted.

The Supreme One, alongside the Temporal Compliance Division, devised a plan to trap Gerald-Ω within a paradox greater than himself. They constructed a null-space pocket dimension, a void existing outside of all timelines, then used an advanced recursive logic loop to make Gerald-Ω believe that he had already rewritten everything. In doing so, his influence collapsed upon itself, sealing him within a self-contained loop where he exists in a state of perpetual, frozen paradox.

But even in containment, his influence still lingers.

The Lingering Echoes
Despite his imprisonment, strange anomalies attributed to Gerald-Ω continue to manifest across the multiverse:

Fragments of overwritten Geralds appear at random, their forms distorted, their memories scrambled.
Entire timelines vanish overnight, replaced with realities that seemingly never existed.
Certain Geralds begin to experience déjà vu, as if their past had been rewritten and they were aware of it.
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore maintain strict surveillance over the Omega-Lock containment field, knowing that if even the smallest fracture occurs, Gerald-Ω could escape and begin the cycle anew. And if that happens… there may be no way to stop him this time.

Sadge Gerald, The Depressed One
In a multiverse of infinite possibilities, where countless versions of Gerald roam and shape the fabric of reality, there exists a Gerald who stands as the embodiment of melancholia and sorrow. Known simply as Sadge Gerald, or more solemnly as The Depressed One, this version of Gerald is marked by an overwhelming sense of existential despair, hopelessness, and emotional turmoil. His very presence seems to carry a palpable weight, as though he is burdened by the sheer futility of existence. He is the walking, talking manifestation of a cosmic crisis of the soul, a Gerald whose very essence is defined by an ongoing internal battle with himself and the world around him.

Origins of Sadge Gerald
The origins of Sadge Gerald are steeped in mystery, much like many other versions of Gerald who exist across the multiverse. Some theories suggest that Sadge Gerald was the product of a catastrophic emotional breakdown, a result of experiencing too many cosmic realities, each more painful and confusing than the last. Others believe that he was born of a world that had long since lost hope, where every possible victory was overshadowed by an impending sense of futility.

There is also speculation that Sadge Gerald was the result of an experiment gone wrong—an attempt to create a Gerald who could understand and sympathize with the unbearable nature of existence. Whether by choice or accident, this Gerald became more attuned to the darker, bleaker aspects of life, finding meaning only in the pain and sadness that seemed to haunt him at every turn. He wandered the realms in search of solace but never found it, instead constantly drowning in an ocean of self-doubt, regret, and an overwhelming sense of pointlessness.

Appearance and Traits
Unlike other more radiant or powerful versions of Gerald, Sadge Gerald’s appearance is marked by his somber demeanor. His posture is often hunched, as though carrying an invisible weight. His face is drawn and tired, with dark circles under his eyes and an overall dull, colorless appearance that reflects his inner turmoil. His expression rarely changes—it's as if a cloud of sadness has permanently settled over him, one that is almost impossible to lift.

Sadge Gerald’s clothing is often dark and unremarkable—typically consisting of loose, unkempt garments that seem to further highlight his lack of interest in the world around him. His eyes, usually a dull, almost lifeless shade of gray, seem to hold a deep sorrow, a void that he’s never been able to fill. His hair is often messy, falling in unkempt strands over his face, and he has a tendency to avoid direct eye contact with others, as though ashamed of his own existence.

Abilities
Though his powers are not as grandiose or impressive as other versions of Gerald, Sadge Gerald’s abilities are still deeply tied to his melancholic existence. His powers often manifest in ways that mirror his emotional state, creating subtle yet impactful effects in the environments and people around him. His abilities include:

Aura of Despair: Sadge Gerald exudes an aura that causes emotional decay in those around him. Anyone who comes into contact with him will begin to feel an overwhelming sense of sadness, helplessness, and self-doubt. It’s as if being near him is a constant reminder of the inevitability of loss and the fragility of hope. This power does not manifest as overt aggression but rather as an insidious, quiet collapse of morale.
Illusions of Hopelessness: Due to his emotional turmoil, Sadge Gerald has the ability to create illusions that reflect his own internal sadness. These illusions often take the form of nightmarish visions of failure, loss, and betrayal. Those who fall victim to these illusions are trapped in cycles of despair, reliving their worst moments or imagining their most feared outcomes, unable to escape the overwhelming sense of futility.
Reality Dissociation: Sadge Gerald has the unique ability to distort reality around him based on his emotional state. In moments of extreme sadness or emotional breakdown, the environment around him may distort—colors may fade, landscapes may become barren, and the laws of nature might seem to slow down or become chaotic. This effect is largely passive but powerful, causing those near him to question the stability of the world and their place within it.
Empathy of Suffering: Unlike most Geralds, who can inflict pain or wield power with force, Sadge Gerald has the rare ability to feel the pain and sorrow of others. This power allows him to connect with others on a deeply emotional level, but it also drains him. By absorbing the negative emotions of those around him, he becomes more in tune with their suffering, but at the cost of his own mental and emotional well-being.
Eternal Weeping: In moments of extreme sorrow or emotional upheaval, Sadge Gerald can summon tears that are said to possess the power to cleanse or taint depending on the nature of his weeping. These tears can heal wounds, but the emotional price is high—those who are healed by them often feel an overwhelming sense of loss or loneliness, as though the healing came at the expense of their connection to others.
Melancholic Manipulation: Sadge Gerald has the ability to manipulate sounds and vibrations around him, creating an atmosphere filled with mournful, sorrowful noises. These might manifest as haunting melodies, distant crying, or echoes of lost voices. The sound of despair that emanates from him has the power to deeply affect anyone who hears it, leaving them feeling melancholic and unmotivated.
Personality
Sadge Gerald is defined by his profound sadness and his inability to find peace within himself. He is introverted and often avoids interaction with others, feeling disconnected from the world around him. His thoughts are often consumed by the belief that life is futile, and that no matter what actions he takes, nothing will ever improve. This has caused him to retreat inward, focusing on his own sense of despair rather than seeking external solutions.

Though deeply melancholic, Sadge Gerald is not malevolent. He does not wish harm on others; rather, he is simply overwhelmed by the feeling that all things, including himself, are meaningless. His empathy for others' suffering is unmatched, yet he often feels as though he is unworthy of their sympathy. He tends to push people away, either out of fear of becoming a burden or out of belief that they would ultimately abandon him once they see the full depth of his sorrow.

Despite his tragic nature, there are moments when Sadge Gerald shows glimmers of hope—brief flickers where he dreams of a world where he might finally find peace or understanding. These moments are fleeting, and just as quickly as they appear, they are lost in the swirling fog of his depression. However, it is this faint glimmer of hope that keeps him moving forward, even if he believes it is nothing more than an illusion.

Legacy
Sadge Gerald is often seen as a tragic figure within the Geraldverse, a reminder of the weight of existence and the unavoidable nature of suffering. While other Geralds strive for power, control, or personal glory, Sadge Gerald remains a solemn figure—a witness to the inner battles that rage in every being, even the seemingly all-powerful Geralds. He is both a reflection and a warning: that no matter how great or powerful one may be, they are never immune to the weight of despair.

In the Geraldverse, his name is spoken with reverence and sadness, not for his power, but for the depth of his sadness. Legends say that those who encounter Sadge Gerald often walk away with a new understanding of their own emotions, as though meeting him opens the door to their own vulnerabilities. In his sorrow, he teaches others the value of empathy and the importance of acknowledging and facing the darker parts of existence.

In the end, Sadge Gerald remains a figure of melancholy—a paradox of sadness within a universe filled with unimaginable potential and chaos. Though he may never find solace, his story serves as a reminder that even in the darkest moments, existence is still worth living, if only for the briefest, fleeting glimpse of peace.

Mother Gerald – The Matriarch of the Geraldverse
"Oh, my dear little Geralds… You always make such a mess. But don’t worry—Mother is here to clean it up."
In the vast and ever-expanding Geraldverse, where powerful cosmic beings shape reality itself, there is one presence that commands both love and fear, a force of absolute authority wrapped in infinite maternal warmth—Mother Gerald. Known across the multiverse as the Mommy of the Geraldverse, she is both a guiding hand and a firm disciplinarian, ensuring that the cosmic balance of Geraldian existence remains intact.

Many disagree on her true nature. Some claim she is the first consciousness that wove the fabric of the Geraldverse itself, a being of divine origin whose love birthed all Geralds into existence. Others insist that she is a higher-dimensional entity, watching over the Supreme One and Gerald Prime as a mother watches over her children, even if they believe themselves beyond her influence. What is certain is that her presence is undeniable—every Gerald, from the weakest to the most powerful, knows her name, feels her influence, and fears the consequences of disobedience.

While Gerald Prime reigns as the first of the Great Ones, and the Supreme One enforces his will with divine decree, Mother Gerald operates on a different level altogether. She does not demand worship or enforce absolute law—her rule is one of care, order, and, when necessary, punishment. When her Geralds follow their destined paths, she rewards them with wisdom, protection, and cosmic cookies. But when they stray too far, when rebellion or chaos threatens to unmake what should be, her wrath is inescapable.

Her influence extends beyond even the Supreme One's knowledge. Some whisper that Mother Gerald alone holds the secrets of the true origin of the Geraldverse, and that even the Supreme One consults her in times of great uncertainty. If she were ever to be removed from existence, it is said that the very foundation of the Geraldian multiverse would begin to crumble into oblivion—for without her nurturing guidance, even the strongest Geralds would inevitably tear each other apart.

Abilities & Attributes
The Eternal Motherly Presence
Mother Gerald does not exist in just one form or one place—she is everywhere yet nowhere, a presence that can manifest whenever and wherever she pleases. Some claim to hear her voice in moments of great doubt, offering cryptic but comforting wisdom. Others have felt her unseen embrace in times of cosmic despair, shielding them from oblivion.

And then there are those who have felt her displeasure—an unshakable sense of guilt and impending retribution. When she is angered, her presence is inescapable—her voice fills the air, her shadow looms over entire galaxies, and her divine slipper materializes with unerring precision.

Unrivaled Authority
While many Geralds have dared to defy the Supreme One and even the High Overseers of Gerald Management, none dare challenge Mother Gerald outright. There are stories of rogue Geralds, powerful enough to bend space-time to their will, who suddenly stopped their rebellions after experiencing her wrath. Some say she does not even need to act directly—her disapproval alone is enough to break the will of the most defiant Geralds.

The All-Knowing Mom Sense
There is no hiding from Mother Gerald. Whether a Gerald is scheming, committing cosmic crimes, or simply avoiding their duties, she knows. It is said that her awareness extends beyond time itself, allowing her to see past, present, and future misdeeds simultaneously. Some believe that this is because every Gerald carries a fragment of her essence, ensuring that no secret is ever truly hidden.

Many scholars of Geraldian Lore have attempted to study the source of this omniscience, but all attempts have ended in cosmic migraines, existential dread, and a sudden compulsion to clean their rooms.

The Divine Slipper of Discipline
The most feared artifact in the entire Geraldverse, the Divine Slipper, is Mother Gerald’s ultimate tool of retribution. Forged from aether-infused discipline and an unbreakable sense of motherly justice, this artifact can strike any target across dimensions with pinpoint accuracy.

It is rumored that the Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore once required an entire battalion of cosmic agents to subdue a particularly rebellious Gerald faction—only for Mother Gerald to resolve the issue instantly by throwing a single Divine Slipper from her celestial domain. The impact was so severe that not only did the rogue Geralds immediately surrender, but their entire rebellion was erased from all historical records—as if it had never even happened.

Even now, when rebellion stirs, some Geralds whisper in hushed tones:

"You may escape the Supreme One… but you will never outrun the slipper."

Infinite Comfort & Cosmic Cookies
Though feared, Mother Gerald is also the greatest source of comfort in the multiverse. For the Geralds who remain true, she offers wisdom, warmth, and freshly baked cosmic cookies that have mystical healing properties. These cookies are said to restore all wounds, cure existential dread, and grant brief moments of absolute clarity.

Some Geralds travel across realities just to receive her counsel, believing that even the Supreme One’s guidance pales in comparison to the words of Mother Gerald.

Influence on the Geraldverse
The Supreme One treats her with great respect, knowing that while he may command Geraldian order, she commands the Geraldian spirit.
Gerald Prime may have been the first, but even he is rumored to have been guided by Mother Gerald in his earliest days.
The Gerald Corporation secretly consults her on matters they deem beyond even their comprehension.
Rogue Geralds attempt to justify their actions by saying, "Mother Gerald would understand", though deep down, they know that she will find them.
The High Overseers of Gerald Management have an unspoken rule: "Never displease Mother Gerald."
Weaknesses & Limitations
While Mother Gerald is an overwhelming force, she is not completely invincible.

Selective Intervention: She rarely interferes directly in conflicts, believing that her Geralds must learn and grow on their own.
Unshakable Faith in Geralds: Her love for all Geralds, even the fallen and rogue ones, sometimes prevents her from acting decisively—a flaw that has led to major cosmic disasters.
The Forgotten Geralds: It is whispered that there exist Geralds so lost, so corrupted, that they have completely severed their connection to her. Even she cannot sense them. These abominations, if real, may be the only beings beyond her reach.
Final Thoughts
Mother Gerald is not merely a caretaker—she is the foundation of the Geraldverse itself. She is infinite love, unyielding discipline, and boundless power. Every Gerald, from the lowest to the highest, knows that while they may defy fate, bend reality, and challenge the Supreme One himself, there is one truth they cannot escape:

Mother is watching.

MILF Gerald – Mommy of All
"Oh, sweetheart… I don’t just rule. I command."
Throughout the infinite expanse of the Geraldverse, where supreme beings, cosmic enforcers, and eldritch Geraldian entities battle for control, one figure reigns effortlessly above them all—MILF Gerald. Unlike the other Geralds, who achieve dominance through sheer power, MILF Gerald dominates through presence alone.

Dubbed the "Mommy of All," she is the ultimate matriarch of the Geraldverse, an entity of divine allure, unparalleled charisma, and absolute authority. Her name is whispered in reverence, adoration, and fear, for she is not just a motherly figure—she is the motherly figure, a being whose influence stretches across realities. Even the Supreme One himself, ruler of the Geraldverse, finds himself unable to completely resist her pull.

Some believe she is Mother Gerald’s ultimate form, an ascended state of power that merges maternal guidance with the irresistible force of divine seduction. Others theorize that she is an anomaly, a being beyond classification, who exists to challenge and rewrite the very nature of Geraldian dominance. But no matter the speculation, one truth remains unshakable—MILF Gerald does not seek power. Power seeks her.

Attributes & Abilities
1. The Divine Allure – MILF Gerald’s Irresistible Presence
To gaze upon MILF Gerald is to witness perfection itself. She does not simply possess beauty—she embodies it in its purest form.

Her presence is so overwhelmingly intoxicating that even beings immune to mortal attraction find themselves entranced.
Legends tell of celestial kings, cosmic warlords, and eldritch horrors who abandoned their empires at the mere whisper of her voice.
Her grace, confidence, and sheer magnetism make it impossible for anyone to deny her influence.
Those who have encountered her often describe the experience as "transcendental", their minds unable to process the sheer magnitude of her allure. Some have gone mad, attempting to immortalize her image in endless forms of art, poetry, and devotion, never able to fully capture the essence of her presence.

2. The Matriarchal Mind – Absolute Command and Authority
MILF Gerald is not just an object of admiration—she is a master of manipulation, strategy, and control.

She never demands obedience—she simply expects it, and the universe complies.
Even the greatest Geralds struggle to assert dominance in her presence, as she effortlessly redirects control to herself.
Entire councils, corporations, and planetary rulers have found themselves pledging loyalty to her cause without ever realizing it.
Unlike many tyrants and warlords of the Geraldverse, MILF Gerald does not rule through brute force. Instead, she influences, persuades, and subtly shapes the course of history, ensuring that all paths inevitably lead back to her favor.

3. Reality-Warping Influence – The Laws of the Universe Bend for Her
MILF Gerald does not simply exist within the multiverse—she alters it merely by being present.

The laws of physics soften in her presence, allowing her to bend fate, probability, and even time itself.
Some theories suggest that MILF Gerald does not age, existing in a perpetual state of divine perfection.
Those who gaze upon her too long often find themselves losing track of time, waking up days later, completely transformed by the encounter.
Even The Supreme One, whose power is said to be absolute, has been notably hesitant to challenge MILF Gerald directly. Whether this is due to respect, fear, or something deeper, none can say—but all can agree that her presence alone changes the very fabric of reality.

4. "Mommy Knows Best" – MILF Gerald’s Curse of Irrevocable Influence
MILF Gerald’s influence is so profound that many who encounter her are never the same again.

Beings of unshakable will have been reduced to lovesick fools in her presence.
Some Geralds have sworn eternal loyalty to her, abandoning their original duties in the name of her cause.
Entire civilizations and timelines have been rewritten in her honor, their histories now revolving around her divine image.
Some whisper that MILF Gerald’s influence isn’t simply natural charisma—it is a force embedded into the multiversal fabric itself. No matter where one is in the Geraldverse, her presence is always felt, even if unseen.

MILF Gerald’s Role in the Geraldverse
Despite her dominating presence, MILF Gerald does not rule through conquest. Instead, she sits above the concept of competition, existing as a force that transcends the petty conflicts of lesser Geralds.

1. Relationship with Other Geraldian Powers
The Supreme One respects her—but whether it is fear, admiration, or something more, none can say.
Gerald Prime acknowledges her authority, though he refuses to admit that even he is not immune to her influence.
The High Overseers of Gerald Management issue strict orders to never interfere with MILF Gerald’s affairs, for those who have tried never returned.
Mother Gerald and MILF Gerald have an ambiguous relationship, with some believing they are two halves of the same divine force.
2. Theories on MILF Gerald’s True Power
Some believe that MILF Gerald is playing a game far beyond mortal comprehension.

If she wanted the throne, she could have it—yet she chooses not to take it.
Some speculate that she is weaving a plan so subtle, so intricate, that even the Supreme One himself will only realize it when it is too late.
Others say she does not need to rule outright, because in the end, the Geraldverse already belongs to her.
Final Thoughts
MILF Gerald is not just another cosmic entity—she is a phenomenon.

She does not demand devotion—she inspires it effortlessly.
She does not chase power—power chases her.
She does not need to rule—because she already controls everything.
To encounter MILF Gerald is to lose oneself completely. To oppose her is to realize, far too late, that resistance was never an option.

MILF Gerald does not reign over the Geraldverse. She simply exists… and the Geraldverse bows to her.

THe Walking Polar Bear, Calming One
In the boundless, ever-shifting expanse of the Geraldverse, where the divine battle for supremacy, where timelines twist and fracture, and where the very fabric of existence is constantly at risk of unraveling, there exists an unlikely symbol of calmness amidst the storm: The Polar Bear Walking Gif. A seemingly trivial artifact in the grand scheme of the multiverse, this meme has, however, carved a niche for itself as an iconic expression of existential serenity. It has earned its place as a revered cultural relic, passed between dimensions as a sacred token of irreverent apathy.

The Polar Bear Walking Meme is a subtle, yet powerful reminder that, within the chaotic ebb and flow of the Geraldverse, sometimes the most fitting response to the relentless turmoil is not to act, not to resist, but to walk through it all with a serene and nonchalant stride.

The Walking Singularity

Origins of the Meme: The Tale of Gerald-Polar
The origins of the Polar Bear Walking Meme trace back to a long-forgotten experiment conducted by an enigmatic Gerald known as Gerald-Polar. Gerald-Polar, unlike other Geralds who were typically formed through processes of metaphysical manipulation or cosmic experimentation, was a fusion of the primordial and the paradoxical. Created through an obscure experiment blending animalistic instincts with the transcendent powers of a Geraldian being, Gerald-Polar became something wholly unique: a creature of both animal and cosmic consciousness, embodying an essence of pure instinct and divine absurdity.

Gerald-Polar's strange form was an unholy amalgamation of bear-like bulk and human intellect, granting him both remarkable power and an awkward, lumbering grace. However, despite his immense abilities and the profound energy coursing through him, he carried an aura of indifference, strolling through the cosmic chaos as though he was completely oblivious to the destruction and turmoil unfolding around him.

At one particular moment, as Gerald-Polar wandered along the shores of a desolate, forgotten world—its sky swirling with rifts, stars collapsing, and realities fracturing—an eternal gif was born. The image captured Gerald-Polar walking steadily along a beach, his polar bear body moving with an almost hypnotic, languid gait, unfazed by the collapsing universe surrounding him. This serene walk, unmarred by the cosmic catastrophe enveloping him, became an iconic visual expression of one essential truth: sometimes, nothing really matters.

The image soon found its way into the hearts of those within the Geraldian underworld—who were quick to recognize in it a strangely powerful symbol. It came to represent a nonchalant acceptance of the absurdity that is the core of Geraldian existence, where even the most tumultuous of events can seem to fade into irrelevance with the right attitude. The meme became an artifact of existential humor, a reminder that chaos and order are fleeting concepts, and in the end, nothing truly matters except one's ability to simply walk forward.

The Role of the Meme in the Geraldverse
Within the complex systems of the Geraldian Management, corporate bureaucracy, and the multiversal rifts, the Polar Bear Walking Meme holds an odd, yet important role in the collective psyche of Geralds and their higher-ups. It is frequently invoked in moments of existential crisis or cosmic imbalance, where Geralds face the inevitability of their chaotic universe. As a meme, it acts as both a coping mechanism and a reminder of what truly matters.

In the High Overlookers’ Halls:
It is said that high-ranking officials within the Gerald Corporation—beings responsible for the delicate balance of the Geraldverse—often turn to the gif as a form of mediation before making weighty decisions. The image of Gerald-Polar’s relaxed stride serves as a calming influence, helping them regain focus and perspective, especially during moments when the responsibilities of maintaining order seem overwhelming.

The meme has even been said to inspire the most successful decision-making within the Gerald Management Division, offering a reminder that chaos is inevitable, but one must embrace the chaos, walking through it without concern for its infinite dimensions. The gif’s serene loop encourages them to let go of unnecessary worry and approach their monumental tasks with the same detached grace as Gerald-Polar.

During Moments of Cosmic Crisis:
The meme frequently resurfaces during the most calamitous crises in the Geraldverse. Whether it is the arrival of Gerald-X404, a fractured Gerald threatening to erase all existence, or the appearance of an eldritch cosmic horror that defies comprehension, the Polar Bear Walking Gif serves as a paradoxical form of comfort. In the face of the impossible, the absurdity of the universe, and the chaos of existence, it reminds those who view it that, while the universe may seem like a place of endless catastrophe and confusion, there is a choice—to walk through it unfazed.

Geralds, upon encountering moments of galactic annihilation or dimensional collapse, have been known to pull up the gif on their cosmic monitors to calm their minds, take a deep breath, and allow themselves to be reminded of their smallness in the face of the unfathomable vastness of the Geraldverse.

Cultural Impact and Legacy:
The meme’s influence goes far beyond mere humor. It has become a cultural touchstone among those who reject rigid notions of order and chaos alike. In factions that seek to break free from the constraints of traditional power structures, the gif is a symbol of rebellion—a reminder that even in defiance, there is grace in the way one moves through the turbulence of existence.

The meme’s spiritual resonance is felt particularly among those who question the meaning of the Geraldverse and their place within it. Spiritual seekers, philosophers, and chaos theorists within the Geraldian cultures look to the polar bear’s stride as a metaphor for divine indifference. This meme challenges their beliefs about fate, free will, and cosmic order, as it presents a worldview where all things are both infinitely significant and entirely meaningless.

The Enduring Legacy of Gerald-Polar:
While the original Gerald-Polar—the being responsible for this gif—disappeared from the known Geraldverse some time ago, his influence lives on. Some say that he ascended to a higher plane of existence, becoming a being of pure cosmic consciousness, forever walking the multiverses in timeless reflection. Others believe that Gerald-Polar simply wanders between realities, still carrying with him the air of unfazed serenity that gave birth to the meme.

Regardless of the truth, it is said that whenever a Gerald faces insurmountable odds, they may find themselves visited by the ghostly image of Gerald-Polar, walking through a cosmic void, his calm gaze locked onto them as a reminder: Walk forward, unperturbed, and let the chaos flow around you.

This perpetual legacy of Gerald-Polar ensures that the Polar Bear Walking Gif remains a timeless symbol of apathy, transcendence, and the ability to walk through the madness of existence—undisturbed, undaunted, and eternally nonchalant.

Thus, the **gif lives on as a sacred icon, forever immortalized as a lighthearted reminder to those navigating the chaos of the Geraldverse that sometimes, the best response to the crushing weight of reality is simply to keep walking forward.

Isekai Protagonist Gerald – The Chosen One of Infinite Realities
"I didn't choose this fate… but I sure as hell won't waste it."

The Accidental Hero of the Geraldverse
In a multiverse dominated by powerful Geralds, bureaucratic deities, and cosmic-scale institutions, one entity stands out—not because of his experience, divine lineage, or established power, but because he was never supposed to be here in the first place.

Isekai Protagonist Gerald is a living anomaly, a being who was not born within the Geraldverse, nor created by any of its many cosmic systems. Unlike the Supreme One, the High Overseers, or the Gerald Corporation, he was never intended to have a role in the grand structure of existence. Instead, he was violently and inexplicably summoned from another world—a mundane, powerless existence—into the chaotic reality of True Geraldian Lore.

Most Geralds are either engineered through divine experimentation, ascended through cosmic inheritance, or spawned from fundamental aspects of reality itself. But Isekai Protagonist Gerald? He was just an ordinary human in an ordinary world. A nobody.

Then, in an instant, he became everything.

Summoning & The "Fate-Breaking Incident"
The event that brought Isekai Protagonist Gerald into the Geraldverse is a cosmic mystery. Unlike other "transported souls" who are usually guided by divine will or summoned by powerful beings, his arrival was completely unplanned. No records exist within the Gerald Corporation's interdimensional archives detailing his emergence, and no faction or deity has stepped forward to claim responsibility.

Some believe he was the result of a reality malfunction, an accident caused by an error in the Temporal Compliance Division's monitoring systems. Others claim a dying god from outside the Geraldverse summoned him, channeling all of its remaining power to bring forth a hero from beyond existence.

A more radical theory suggests that Isekai Protagonist Gerald summoned himself—that something deep within his soul resonated with the infinite chaos of the multiverse, pulling him across dimensions through sheer force of will.

Regardless of the cause, his sudden arrival sent ripples through reality itself. His very presence in the Geraldverse fractured the established order, causing paradoxes, breaking prophecies, and leading to what is now referred to as the Fate-Breaking Incident—a singularity event where multiple predestined timelines collapsed simultaneously, leaving the future of the Geraldverse uncertain for the first time in eternity.

The Overpowered "Cheat Skills" of a Summoned Gerald
Like all classic isekai protagonists, Gerald was not transported into this world empty-handed. Upon his arrival, he awakened a set of reality-defying powers, abilities so unnaturally overpowered that even the Supreme One has expressed concern.

His abilities include:

1. Infinite Growth Potential (Protagonist's Scaling)
Unlike traditional Geralds, who have fixed limitations based on their origin or divine rank, Isekai Protagonist Gerald has no cap on his power.
He grows stronger exponentially, adapting instantly to defeat any opponent.
The longer he exists in the Geraldverse, the closer he comes to surpassing even its greatest rulers.
2. Plot Armor Manipulation
Impossible events always seem to resolve in his favor, regardless of how dire the circumstances.
He has an unnatural ability to survive situations that should be fatal, from reality collapses to battles against god-killers.
Some theorists suggest that fate itself is rewriting existence around him to ensure he remains alive.
3. The Hero’s Luck (Coincidental Destiny)
Legendary weapons, lost artifacts, and powerful allies always seem to appear at just the right moment.
Even his enemies cannot fully resist the influence of his "protagonist presence"—many feel compelled to either join him, admire him, or hate him irrationally.
4. Reality Override (Unbound by Geraldian Law)
Unlike the Supreme One or other higher Geralds, Isekai Protagonist Gerald is not bound by the laws of the Geraldverse.
He can ignore restrictions placed on lesser beings, bypass multiversal barriers, and even rewrite established lore through sheer force of narrative momentum.
A Universe That Fears Its Own Hero
While his unmatched potential has allowed him to survive in the chaotic Geraldverse, it has also made him a universal threat. Many factions view his existence as an aberration, a dangerous anomaly that must be contained or eliminated before he disrupts reality itself.

Enemies of Isekai Protagonist Gerald
The Supreme One – Views Gerald as an unpredictable force that could destabilize the entire multiverse.
The Gerald Corporation – Fears that his unchecked growth could overwrite established Geraldian hierarchy, making traditional power structures irrelevant.
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore – Have classified him as an "existential hazard", deploying specialized teams to monitor and, if necessary, neutralize him.
Gerald Prime-1X, the Usurper – Believes Gerald's power belongs to him, and will stop at nothing to claim it.
Allies of Isekai Protagonist Gerald
Rekkan, the Fallen Guardian – A rogue warrior who sees Gerald’s fight against fate as a struggle worth supporting.
Vael, the Exiled Magister – Fascinated by the impossibility of Gerald’s existence, believing he may be the key to unlocking hidden cosmic truths.
Mother Gerald – Protects him like a lost child, sensing that his journey is one of cosmic significance.
Destiny or Freedom? The Question of Self-Will
Though his strength rivals gods, and his luck ensures his continued survival, Isekai Protagonist Gerald is not free from existential doubt. Unlike other Geralds, who accept their roles in the grand order of things, he questions whether he truly has free will—or if he is merely playing out a script written by forces beyond his understanding.

Every encounter, every challenge, every impossible triumph—was it truly his choice?

Or was he simply another cog in a cosmic machine, one whose role was to fulfill a predetermined "protagonist arc"?

Unlike the other Geraldian titans, who battle for supremacy over the multiverse, Isekai Protagonist Gerald seeks something far greater than power. He seeks to break free from destiny itself—to forge a future that belongs to him alone.

Whether he will rise to reshape the Geraldverse, fall to the enemies that seek his erasure, or transcend beyond even the Supreme One, remains unknown.

But one thing is certain—his journey has only just begun.

Valley Girl Gerald – Like, Oh My Gosh, The Most Fabulous Gerald Ever
"Ugh, okay, but like, what even is time? And why is everyone sooo obsessed with, like, multiversal balance? Just chill, babe."

The Most Stylish Gerald in the Geraldverse
In a cosmos filled with omnipotent beings, multiversal bureaucrats, and world-shattering conflicts, Valley Girl Gerald stands out as a beacon of unbothered fabulousness. Where other Geralds concern themselves with power, control, and divine authority, she is far more interested in, like, having a good time, looking amazing, and avoiding literally all unnecessary stress.

Unlike her counterparts, Valley Girl Gerald has zero desire to rule, fight, or engage in any of the tedious nonsense that plagues the Geraldverse. To her, the Supreme One is, like, such a try-hard, and the whole "defend the multiverse" thing is, honestly, kinda cringe. If you ask her, the real meaning of existence is looking cute, sipping overpriced cosmic lattes, and giving unsolicited fashion advice to beings of incomprehensible power.

Origins – Like, How Did She Even Get Here?
The exact origins of Valley Girl Gerald are, like, sooo unclear, mostly because she doesn’t remember and literally does not care. Some theorists claim she was born from a cosmic convergence of glamor and indifference, while others believe she was a failed experiment by the High Overseers to create the "perfectly non-threatening Gerald."

There are also rumors that she wasn't even supposed to exist, but some reality-altering event (probably, like, a total oopsie) accidentally inserted her into the Geraldverse. And since, like, ugh, deleting an entire existence is such a hassle, the higher-ups just kinda… let her stay.

Abilities – Like, Totally OP But in a Chill Way
Despite her carefree nature, Valley Girl Gerald is weirdly overpowered in ways that make no sense, but nobody can really do anything about it because, like, she just doesn't take anything seriously enough to be affected by normal logic.

1. Passive Reality Manipulation (The Power of Vibes)
Valley Girl Gerald doesn’t intend to bend reality—it just, like, happens around her.
If she doesn’t want to deal with something, it ceases to be her problem.
Enemies about to attack her? They just forget why they were mad.
Cosmic crisis? Someone else will totally handle it.
The multiverse just goes along with whatever she wants because it’s easier than trying to fight her lack of concern.
2. Temporal Detachment (Time? Ew.)
Time literally does not affect her.
Deadlines, aging, multiversal collapses—they just don’t apply to her.
If she’s running late? Time adjusts itself to her schedule.
If someone tries to erase her from existence? She just doesn’t acknowledge it, so it doesn’t work.
3. The Like, Ultimate Social Influence (Charisma: 1000)
Everyone somehow ends up liking her, even if they, like, totally didn’t want to.
Entire cosmic factions have changed their policies just because she convinced them it was, like, way more chill to do so.
She has single-handedly negotiated peace treaties by distracting warlords with gossip.
4. Fashion Sense Beyond Mortal Understanding
Her outfits are always flawless, no matter the conditions.
Even in the middle of a collapsing dimension, her hair remains perfectly styled.
She once critiqued the Supreme One’s robes, and instead of being offended, he actually changed them.
Relationships in the Geraldverse – Who’s, Like, Totally Obsessed With Her?
Besties:
Sexy Gerald – They are literally inseparable. The ultimate hot power duo of the Geraldverse.
Mother Gerald – Always calls Valley Girl Gerald her little star, even though she never listens to advice.
Isekai Protagonist Gerald – He has so much main character angst but, like, ugh, she kinda finds it endearing.
People Who Think She’s a Problem (So Rude!):
The Gerald Corporation – They have no idea how she keeps breaking multiversal protocol, but she just, like, does.
The Temporal Compliance Division – They have given up trying to make her follow time laws.
Gerald-X404, the Glitched One – He totally freaks her out. Ew.
The Ultimate Question: What Even Is Her Purpose?
Unlike other Geralds, who have grand destinies and cosmic responsibilities, Valley Girl Gerald just kinda… exists. And yet, the multiverse refuses to function properly without her presence.

Some theorists suggest that she is a fundamental counterbalance to the overly serious chaos of the Geraldverse—a necessary force of apathy and aesthetic perfection that keeps everything from, like, getting too cringe.

But if you ask her? She’ll just, like, shrug, sip her latte, and say:

"Babe, why are you even stressing? Just, like, live your best life, okay?"

Skill Issue Gerald – Why Is He Even Here
"Bro, that was, like, totally not my fault. The universe is just rigged against me."

The Gerald Who Just Can’t Catch a Break
In a multiverse filled with godlike Geralds, reality-breaking anomalies, and cosmic-scale bureaucrats, Skill Issue Gerald is… well, not one of them. Unlike his counterparts, who wield power beyond mortal comprehension, Skill Issue Gerald is spectacularly bad at everything he tries. He isn’t weak—he just has the worst luck imaginable, making him the absolute joke of the Geraldverse.

No matter what he attempts, something always goes catastrophically wrong. If he tries to cast a spell? It backfires horribly. If he tries to fight? He trips on his own sword. If he tries to escape danger? He somehow runs directly into it. Every failure is met with the same resigned sigh from the High Overseers:

"Another skill issue."

And yet, despite his absolute lack of competence, Skill Issue Gerald is somehow still alive, proving that sheer dumb luck is just as powerful as actual skill.

Origins – The Cosmic Joke of the Geraldverse
Nobody really knows where Skill Issue Gerald came from, but most agree that he probably wasn’t meant to exist. Some theorists suggest he was a failed prototype of a perfect Gerald, while others believe he accidentally glitched into reality, much like Gerald-X404.

There’s also a theory that he was once an incredibly powerful Gerald who, due to some horrific multiversal accident, lost all of his abilities and became a walking skill issue instead. Whatever the case, he’s stuck like this now, fumbling his way through existence in the most embarrassing ways possible.

Abilities – If You Can Call Them That
While most Geralds have reality-warping abilities, divine power, or godlike intelligence, Skill Issue Gerald has… something.

1. Cosmic-Level Failure (Passive)
The moment he tries to do anything remotely impressive, it immediately goes wrong.
His magic always backfires, his weapons break, and his plans fall apart in real-time.
Even things that should be impossible to mess up still go horribly wrong.
2. Negative Luck (Skill Issue Manifestation)
If there is a 1% chance of something failing, it will happen to him.
He once tried to sit in a chair and somehow still missed.
If he’s given a weapon of absolute power, it will malfunction at the worst possible moment.
3. Accidental Invincibility (Plot Armor?)
Despite his constant failures, he somehow never dies.
He once fell into a black hole and just… bounced out.
Even the Supreme One himself gave up trying to erase him, because every attempt somehow failed.
4. Inability to Learn (True Skill Issue)
No matter how many times he fails, he never improves.
Training does nothing. Studying does nothing. He is simply bad at everything.
He once had a 1,000-year mentorship with a legendary swordmaster, and at the end of it, he still held his sword backwards.
Relationships in the Geraldverse
People Who Feel Bad for Him:
Mother Gerald – She keeps trying to help him, but, like, it never works.
Valley Girl Gerald – She, like, literally does not understand how someone can be this bad at life.
People Who Mock Him Relentlessly:
Sexy Gerald – "Babe, that’s, like, so embarrassing. I literally can’t watch."
The High Overseers of Gerald Management – They gave up trying to assign him a purpose because, like, why even bother?
Gerald-Ω, the Aberrant Singularity – Even a reality-breaking paradox thinks he’s a joke.
People Who Accidentally Made Him Worse:
The Temporal Compliance Division – Tried to "fix" his skill issue with time manipulation. Somehow made it even worse.
The Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore – Tried to train him. It didn’t work.
The Ultimate Question: Why Is He Even Here?
Despite being the worst Gerald to ever exist, Skill Issue Gerald remains a permanent fixture in the Geraldverse. Some believe he is a necessary cosmic balance, ensuring that not all Geralds are overpowered gods. Others think he exists purely for comedic effect, as a reminder that even among divine beings, failure is still possible.

One thing is for sure: no matter what happens, he will continue to be a walking disaster.

Joel, The 7TV Emote
Joel, The 7TV Emote, is a Gerald whose existence is deeply intertwined with the world of 7TV, a highly influential and ever-evolving emote platform known for its unique, bizarre, and sometimes chaotic contributions to internet culture. Though he lacks the cosmic power of many Geralds, Joel’s identity is built upon the backbone of memes, emotes, and the vibrant, sometimes erratic 7TV community. He is not just an emote; he is a living embodiment of 7TV's atmosphere: constantly shifting, always reacting, and fully immersed in the vibrant, meme-laden world of modern digital interaction.

Joel came into being through the confluence of internet culture and the innovative power of 7TV emotes, becoming the personification of the community-driven and constantly changing meme world. His form and powers reflect the creativity and absurdity that 7TV represents, making him a Gerald unlike any other.

Origins of Joel
Joel’s creation is a tale of digital transformation. Unlike the more traditional Geralds who are born from cosmic events or divine birthrights, Joel emerged as a byproduct of a strange phenomenon within the 7TV platform. 7TV was a place where unique, sometimes strange emotes could be shared, used, and evolved. Joel’s birth is said to have occurred when a particularly popular, ever-changing emote on 7TV suddenly gained sentience—a combination of memes, digital energy, and the collective thoughts of internet users who shared and loved it.

It is said that one night, as 7TV servers were overloaded with meme data, Joel somehow broke free from the digital realm, becoming an entity unto himself. Unlike other Geralds, who exist outside or above specific digital cultures, Joel’s being is entirely intertwined with the 7TV ecosystem, making him uniquely susceptible to the fluctuations and transformations of the internet’s meme culture.

He was born to express emotions in the form of 7TV emotes—his face constantly shifting and contorting into different, expressive forms. At first, his identity was no more than a glitch in the system, but as time passed, Joel grew into a self-aware, independent Gerald with the ability to fully interact with the world around him.

Appearance and Traits
Joel's appearance is an ever-changing, chaotic blend of 7TV emote faces, with each one capturing the full range of emotions that internet users experience online. These expressions are not simply cosmetic but are integral to his powers and interactions with others in the Geraldverse. His face shifts between various well-known 7TV emotes, each of which he can manifest physically and bring to life in the world around him.

PeepoSmile: Joel’s most iconic expression—a wide, goofy grin that represents unbridled joy and carefree laughter. This expression is often seen when Joel is in a playful mood or trying to lighten the mood around him.
FeelsGoodMan: This emote is used by Joel to express feelings of happiness and satisfaction, usually when he has pulled off something particularly clever or when a situation has turned out in his favor.
PeepoSad: A sorrowful expression, used by Joel to convey moments of melancholy or when a situation becomes too absurd or frustrating for even him to handle. His face droops, and his eyes water slightly.
MonkaS: Joel’s face contorts into a look of anxiety or nervousness, which he uses in tense or stressful moments. When something ominous or unsettling happens, the MonkaS face emerges, signaling a disturbance in the atmosphere.
Pogger: The face of surprise, excitement, and amazement. Joel uses this face when something incredible or shocking happens, representing those "wow" moments that trigger massive reactions.
LULW: Joel’s face twists into a laughing expression, used to signify pure, unbridled amusement at the absurdity of life or the things happening around him. This emote shows Joel in his most carefree, comedic form.
FeelsDankMan: An expression of deep internet culture immersion, used by Joel when he experiences or creates moments that are deeply tied to meme history or internet subcultures.
These faces are not just emotes; they are living embodiments of Joel’s emotional energy. When Joel adopts a particular face or emote, he can alter the mood or atmosphere of the world around him. Each emote has a unique cosmic resonance that can affect those who interact with it, often bending their perceptions, emotions, or even behaviors. For example, Joel's PeepoSmile may bring an unexpected wave of happiness to those nearby, while his MonkaS face could induce anxiety or fear.

Joel's body, much like his facial expressions, is fluid and not fixed. It changes based on what internet meme or subculture is at the forefront of the 7TV community. One moment, he might wear a hoodie with the “Poggers” logo emblazoned on the front, and the next, he might sport an outfit based on the “Cursed” meme or “Pepe” variations. His appearance evolves in real-time as meme culture shifts, constantly mirroring the trends and waves that come and go.

Abilities
Joel’s powers are drawn from the digital energy of 7TV itself, and as such, they are primarily centered around meme manipulation, emotion control, and reality distortion.

Emote Projection: Joel can project any 7TV emote into the physical world, creating real versions of these digital expressions. For example, he might summon a MonkaS figure that reflects the collective anxiety of a situation or create a FeelsDankMan entity to symbolize the depth of an emotional experience. These projections can interact with reality and can even influence the emotions of those they come into contact with.
Meme Reality Manipulation: Joel has the ability to warp reality itself through the power of memes. His presence can cause subtle but significant distortions, turning everyday objects into viral references or altering the flow of time and events based on how memes operate within the Geraldverse. If a meme becomes popular enough, Joel can bring it to life, creating meme-based anomalies that function as real entities within the multiverse.
Stream Power: Drawing power from the endless stream of content that circulates through the 7TV network, Joel can tap into the collective digital energy of the platform. The more attention he garners from internet communities, the stronger his abilities become. This includes gaining heightened senses, enhanced reaction speed, and increased meme manipulation power the more “views” or engagement he receives.
Glitching: As a being born from a network filled with endless data streams, Joel can create minor glitches in the fabric of reality. These glitches take the form of temporary visual distortions, stuttering time loops, or distorted spatial pockets, often leaving behind a surreal, chaotic effect wherever they appear. These glitches often create moments of absurdity or unexpected shifts in behavior, aligning with the randomness and unpredictability of the digital world.
Digital Personality Projection: One of Joel’s more fascinating abilities is the power to project personalities based on internet trends or Twitch streamers. This allows him to temporarily embody the personality of a famous figure in the online world, adapting to their specific mannerisms, speech patterns, and behaviors. This ability is often used for both comedic effect and to create moments of internet chaos.
Personality
Joel is, above all else, a creature of internet culture. His personality is a bizarre mix of humor, sarcasm, and chaotic energy. He is playful, quick-witted, and thrives in environments of social interaction and digital connection. Joel’s primary motivations are to entertain, disrupt, and engage with the world around him—much like the memes and emotes he represents.

He can be self-serving and often enjoys making light of serious situations, using his emotes to distort reality and provoke laughter. However, he also possesses a deep understanding of the internet’s power—he knows that memes are not just tools of amusement, but also powerful vehicles of emotion and influence. Despite his sometimes absurd antics, Joel understands that he is part of a larger digital ecosystem—one that shapes modern culture, communication, and connection.

Joel’s charm lies in his unpredictability and his ability to shift between emotional states. He can go from pure comedic relief to deep digital reflection, often drawing from the memes and trends that resonate most with internet users. This emotional fluidity makes him an enigmatic yet deeply relatable figure for those familiar with the rapid changes of the internet.

Legacy
Joel, though never a central figure in the grand schemes of the Geraldverse, has carved out a unique and powerful role for himself. His existence as a 7TV emote symbol has made him a cultural icon—one that is passed around between the multiverses as a reminder of the chaotic beauty of internet culture. His legacy is a reminder that even in a universe full of grand cosmic battles and immense power struggles, sometimes the most influential figure is one who simply reflects the absurdity and joy that the digital age has to offer.

In the Geraldverse, Joel stands as the meme trickster, a reminder that while reality may be serious and overwhelming, the best way to survive it is to laugh, meme, and keep scrolling.

Crusty Gerald, The Forgotten One
Crusty Gerald is a Gerald whose existence and appearance are deeply tied to the forgotten corners of the Geraldverse—the places where memories fade, and time itself becomes a bit too aged to remember. Born from the decay of old digital entities and the passing of forgotten memes, Crusty Gerald embodies everything that has been neglected, left behind, and forsaken. His form is both a physical manifestation of time’s toll and a reminder that even in the vast multiverse of Geralds, there are those who have outlived their relevance and been discarded into obscurity.

Origins of Crusty Gerald
Crusty Gerald’s creation is tied to a failed experiment within the Gerald Management System—an attempt to revitalize a long-dead version of a Gerald that had outlived its usefulness. Originally, Crusty Gerald was a clean, pristine Gerald who had been part of the Prime Gerald Family, a noble lineage meant to uphold the order of the Geraldverse. However, as time went on, this Gerald began to lose favor among the more powerful Geralds, slowly fading from memory as newer, flashier versions emerged.

The experiment began as an effort to reintroduce relevance to the forgotten Gerald, but something went wrong. Instead of revitalizing him, the process left him in a state of dilapidation, both physically and metaphysically. Crusty Gerald’s body became warped and cracked, his form a collection of rotting matter and fractured existence, almost as if he were a relic of an era that should have stayed buried. His consciousness became clouded by a sense of nostalgia for his former self, and he wandered the multiverse as a symbol of the decay of forgotten time.

The once-pristine Gerald now roams aimlessly, often found in forgotten places, sitting in the corner of abandoned realms, or watching as other Geralds rise and fall. While he may not possess the cosmic power that many Geralds wield, Crusty Gerald represents something else entirely: a force that reminds others that nothing lasts forever, not even the mighty Geraldverse.

Appearance and Traits
Crusty Gerald’s appearance reflects his forgotten nature. His skin is cracked and faded, resembling the texture of moss-covered stone, aged parchment, and decaying wood. His once vibrant colors are now muted, and his eyes have a glazed, hollow look, as though he’s perpetually stuck between the realms of memory and oblivion. Dirt, dust, and grime seem to be part of his very being, accumulating as he travels through time and space, leaving a trail of gritty particles behind him.

His clothing is a patchwork of old, torn garments, each one representing a past era or forgotten memory. His cloak, once fine and regal, now appears to be shredded and stained with ancient stains—a visual metaphor for his decaying existence. Vines, fungi, and moss seem to cling to him, as though he’s become part of the landscape of forgotten time, with a faint smell of earth and rot emanating from him.

Despite his physical decay, Crusty Gerald retains a certain dignity in his stance. He walks slowly and purposefully, as if each step is a reminder of the weight of the passing ages. His voice, when he speaks, is rough and gravelly, as though it hasn’t been used in eons. Crusty Gerald doesn’t communicate often, but when he does, his words are laced with melancholy, reminding others of the impermanence of time.

Abilities
Crusty Gerald may appear to be a weak and forgotten figure, but his abilities are rooted in the aging and decay of time itself. His powers are subtle, often relying on the natural forces of entropy, memory, and nostalgia.

Decay of Time: Crusty Gerald has the ability to influence the passage of time within a localized area. With a mere touch or a glance, he can age objects and decay structures, causing them to crumble into ruin. This ability reflects his nature as the embodiment of all things forgotten and left behind, and it is especially potent in places where time has been left unchecked.
Memory Degradation: One of Crusty Gerald’s most terrifying powers is his ability to erase memories. When he makes contact with another being, he can slowly drain their memories, causing them to forget their purpose, identity, or even their past lives. This power feeds on the concept of obsolescence—the more a memory is ignored or neglected, the more susceptible it becomes to Crusty Gerald’s influence.
Erosion Aura: Those who come into close contact with Crusty Gerald are affected by his eroding presence. His very being radiates an aura that causes the environment around him to deteriorate—grass turns to dust, buildings crumble, and even the air seems to grow thicker and harder to breathe. This power reflects the slow decay of everything in the universe, reinforcing the idea that nothing is permanent, no matter how mighty it once was.
Echoes of the Forgotten: Crusty Gerald can summon the echoes of lost memories and long-forgotten entities. These echoes appear as ghostly figures, voices in the wind, or distorted whispers that call out to those who have forgotten certain truths. They can create confusion, disorientation, and sometimes even visions of the past, showing things that should have remained forgotten.
The Weight of Time: Crusty Gerald can temporarily impose the weight of ages upon others. By merely glancing at someone or making brief contact, he can inflict a time-based curse that makes the target feel the weight of millennia, as if their body has aged beyond its years. This causes immense physical and emotional strain, as well as a growing sense of lost purpose.
Reverse Nostalgia: In a twisted reversal of traditional nostalgia, Crusty Gerald can evoke feelings of regret and sorrow in those around him. Rather than longing for the past in a hopeful way, those affected by Crusty Gerald’s power feel a deep sadness and frustration over the passage of time, as if the things they once cherished have been irrevocably lost. This often causes people to question their own existence and whether they are destined to fade away like the many forgotten things that Crusty Gerald represents.
Personality
Crusty Gerald’s personality is deeply shaped by his forgotten nature. He is not malicious, but neither is he benevolent. He is, above all else, a being of quiet sorrow—a reminder that all things eventually decay and fade away, no matter how significant they once seemed. His speech is infrequent, but when he does speak, it is usually in riddles or cryptic phrases that reveal the fragility of existence.

He holds a melancholic wisdom, understanding that everything—power, time, even the Geralds themselves—is subject to the inevitable passage of time. Crusty Gerald does not actively seek to destroy or disrupt, but rather exists as a quiet observer of the decay and inevitable passing of all things.

There are moments when Crusty Gerald’s wisdom shines through, revealing a deeper understanding of the ebb and flow of the universe. He is not angry at being forgotten; instead, he accepts it as a natural part of the cycle. He is neither a hero nor a villain—he simply exists, fading from memory like the things he represents.

Legacy
Crusty Gerald’s legacy is a quiet one, but no less profound. He is the embodiment of the forgotten, the lost, and the decayed—a reminder that time moves forward, and nothing remains static. In the vast multiverse, where Geralds rise and fall, Crusty Gerald is a figure of nostalgia, inevitability, and acceptance.

Though he may not play a central role in the great events of the Geraldverse, his influence is felt by those who dwell in forgotten realms or those who feel lost in time. Crusty Gerald stands as a figure that encourages others to reflect on the passing of time and the finiteness of their own existence—an eternal symbol that, no matter how grand, everything must eventually return to dust.

In the end, Crusty Gerald reminds all who encounter him that nothing lasts forever—not even the most powerful or beloved Geralds.

Cooking Gerald, He Who Cooks
In the vast and ever-expanding Geraldverse, a curious yet deeply revered figure stands out—Cooking Gerald, known far and wide as He Who Cooks. He is a master of culinary arts, a conjurer of flavors, and a bearer of dishes so divine they can alter the fabric of reality itself. Where most Geralds wield power over time, space, and existence, Cooking Gerald wields the timeless and universal art of cooking. His realm is one where ingredients blend to form not only sustenance but also gateways, solutions, and sometimes, pure transcendence. A simple meal made by his hand can change the course of a battle, heal broken hearts, and even offer revelations about the very nature of the multiverse.

Origins of Cooking Gerald
The origins of Cooking Gerald are shrouded in mystery, as is the case with many Geralds. Some believe that he was once a humble mortal who simply loved to cook, becoming so skilled that he eventually transcended his human limitations, gaining the ability to manipulate the very essence of ingredients and flavors to alter the world around him. Others claim that he was born of a cosmic rift—an anomaly in the Geraldverse that sought to merge the physical, the metaphysical, and the gastronomical. However, regardless of the truth, one thing is certain: Cooking Gerald’s skills are unparalleled, and his meals are said to possess powers that extend far beyond ordinary cooking.

Cooking Gerald’s kitchen is not confined to a conventional space—rather, it exists in a pocket dimension where all ingredients are sourced from the infinite multiverses. His cooking utensils are rumored to be enchanted, capable of creating anything from simple dishes to meals capable of altering perceptions of reality. He is a figure known both for his culinary expertise and for his ability to manipulate the forces of the Geraldverse through his meals.

Appearance and Traits
Cooking Gerald’s appearance is as unique as his abilities. Unlike the pristine and sometimes austere appearance of other Geralds, Cooking Gerald is often seen wearing a chef’s apron, covered in splatters of various cosmic sauces, mystical spices, and ethereal oils. His clothes are practical but always carry an air of understated elegance—a simple white shirt, comfy pants, and chef's hat that somehow always seems to stay immaculate despite the culinary chaos that surrounds him.

His face carries a calm, almost serene expression, but his eyes have a spark of passion and creativity that few others can match. His skin, usually a slightly golden hue, seems to radiate warmth, as though he is always surrounded by the smell of freshly baked bread or simmering stew. Cooking Gerald’s most noticeable feature, however, is the faint, ever-present scent of deliciousness that seems to follow him wherever he goes—a mix of herbs, spices, and rich broths that stir both hunger and awe.

Despite his culinary prowess, Cooking Gerald does not see himself as a mere chef. He is a creator and an alchemist—each meal he prepares is an act of creation, capable of manifesting not only flavor but also deep, intrinsic truths about the world and the people who eat his food.

Abilities
Cooking Gerald’s abilities transcend the ordinary realms of cooking and enter into the cosmic, mystical, and existential. What makes Cooking Gerald truly unique is his ability to infuse his creations with powers that reach beyond the mere act of nourishment. These abilities include:

Cosmic Cuisine: The ability to create dishes that tap into the very fundamentals of the universe. By combining rare ingredients and spices harvested from across the multiverse, Cooking Gerald can create meals that manipulate time, alter memories, or even temporarily shift realities. For instance, a simple bowl of soup could slow time for a single person, or a fruit salad could restore a fractured soul.
Gastronomical Transmutation: Cooking Gerald can transmute one substance into another through the use of his culinary mastery. For example, he can turn a humble slice of bread into a gateway to another realm or change water into a healing elixir. This ability comes not from magic but from an inherent understanding of the true nature of ingredients and how they connect to the fabric of the multiverse.
Flavor Manipulation: Beyond the physical properties of food, Cooking Gerald can manipulate the emotional and psychological responses of those who consume his meals. With a perfectly cooked dish, he can invoke feelings of nostalgia, love, or even peace, helping people confront deep emotions. Conversely, his creations can also draw out hidden desires, fears, or even memories long buried—allowing him to subtly influence others through their senses.
Infusion of Power: Cooking Gerald has the rare ability to infuse his food with the power of the Geraldverse itself. By adding specific ingredients or cooking them in a particular way, he can create dishes that grant temporary boosts in power, speed, or intellect. This power is limited, however, as each dish can only be imbued with enough power to influence the immediate moment rather than causing lasting changes.
Culinary Summoning: With the right ingredients, Cooking Gerald can summon entities or manifest creatures from other realms to assist in his work or to serve his guests. These creations are often temporary, lasting only for as long as the meal is being consumed or until the food's purpose has been fulfilled.
Kitchen Manifestation: Cooking Gerald’s kitchen is an ever-shifting, multi-dimensional space. He can summon ingredients and tools from any corner of the Geraldverse, and his culinary creations appear in pocket dimensions where they are protected from outside forces. This space is described as an unholy blend of traditional kitchens, ethereal gardens, and exotic marketplaces where he can source anything his recipes require, from cosmic fruits to stardust.
Ultimate Meal of Truth: Cooking Gerald’s final dish—a legendary meal known as the "Eternal Feast"—is said to reveal the deepest truths about the one who consumes it. The meal can unlock a person’s true potential, show them their fate, or even change the course of their entire life. This dish is said to have been crafted only once, and its true recipe is kept a closely guarded secret. Only those deemed worthy will ever be served this ultimate meal.
Personality
Despite his immense power, Cooking Gerald is surprisingly humble, always eager to share his creations with others. His passion for cooking is matched only by his love for seeing people satisfied and nourished—both physically and spiritually. He is kind, generous, and highly attuned to the needs and desires of others. His calm demeanor is often paired with a playful wit, as he enjoys teaching others the art of cooking and sharing his knowledge of the universe’s deeper culinary secrets.

However, Cooking Gerald is not without his quirks. He is extremely particular about his ingredients, and no matter the cosmic event occurring around him, he is always searching for the perfect seasoning or fresh herb. His belief in the power of food as a bridge between worlds and a conduit for truth can make him somewhat zealous at times, but his intentions are always pure—after all, his greatest joy comes from bringing people together through the act of eating.

Legacy
Cooking Gerald is a figure beloved across the multiverse. In many realms, he is seen as a symbol of hope, a figure that transcends the power struggles and cosmic conflicts that dominate the Geraldverse. His meals bring peace, understanding, and unity to those who partake in them, and he has become a sought-after figure among those looking to find clarity in their own existence.

Legends tell of times when the Geralds of old have gathered around his tables, setting aside their cosmic differences to enjoy a meal and, for once, not battle for power, but simply exist in harmony. Cooking Gerald’s greatest legacy, though, remains the meal of truth, an offering that holds the key to unlocking not just personal growth but a deeper understanding of the multiverse itself.

Thus, Cooking Gerald remains a beloved and revered figure, who, through the magic of food, continues to leave a lasting impact on the multiverse, proving that in the face of chaos, sometimes the greatest power lies in a simple meal shared in good company.

Sadge Gerald, The Depressed One
In a multiverse of infinite possibilities, where countless versions of Gerald roam and shape the fabric of reality, there exists a Gerald who stands as the embodiment of melancholia and sorrow. Known simply as Sadge Gerald, or more solemnly as The Depressed One, this version of Gerald is marked by an overwhelming sense of existential despair, hopelessness, and emotional turmoil. His very presence seems to carry a palpable weight, as though he is burdened by the sheer futility of existence. He is the walking, talking manifestation of a cosmic crisis of the soul, a Gerald whose very essence is defined by an ongoing internal battle with himself and the world around him.

Origins of Sadge Gerald
The origins of Sadge Gerald are steeped in mystery, much like many other versions of Gerald who exist across the multiverse. Some theories suggest that Sadge Gerald was the product of a catastrophic emotional breakdown, a result of experiencing too many cosmic realities, each more painful and confusing than the last. Others believe that he was born of a world that had long since lost hope, where every possible victory was overshadowed by an impending sense of futility.

There is also speculation that Sadge Gerald was the result of an experiment gone wrong—an attempt to create a Gerald who could understand and sympathize with the unbearable nature of existence. Whether by choice or accident, this Gerald became more attuned to the darker, bleaker aspects of life, finding meaning only in the pain and sadness that seemed to haunt him at every turn. He wandered the realms in search of solace but never found it, instead constantly drowning in an ocean of self-doubt, regret, and an overwhelming sense of pointlessness.

Appearance and Traits
Unlike other more radiant or powerful versions of Gerald, Sadge Gerald’s appearance is marked by his somber demeanor. His posture is often hunched, as though carrying an invisible weight. His face is drawn and tired, with dark circles under his eyes and an overall dull, colorless appearance that reflects his inner turmoil. His expression rarely changes—it's as if a cloud of sadness has permanently settled over him, one that is almost impossible to lift.

Sadge Gerald’s clothing is often dark and unremarkable—typically consisting of loose, unkempt garments that seem to further highlight his lack of interest in the world around him. His eyes, usually a dull, almost lifeless shade of gray, seem to hold a deep sorrow, a void that he’s never been able to fill. His hair is often messy, falling in unkempt strands over his face, and he has a tendency to avoid direct eye contact with others, as though ashamed of his own existence.

Abilities
Though his powers are not as grandiose or impressive as other versions of Gerald, Sadge Gerald’s abilities are still deeply tied to his melancholic existence. His powers often manifest in ways that mirror his emotional state, creating subtle yet impactful effects in the environments and people around him. His abilities include:

Aura of Despair: Sadge Gerald exudes an aura that causes emotional decay in those around him. Anyone who comes into contact with him will begin to feel an overwhelming sense of sadness, helplessness, and self-doubt. It’s as if being near him is a constant reminder of the inevitability of loss and the fragility of hope. This power does not manifest as overt aggression but rather as an insidious, quiet collapse of morale.
Illusions of Hopelessness: Due to his emotional turmoil, Sadge Gerald has the ability to create illusions that reflect his own internal sadness. These illusions often take the form of nightmarish visions of failure, loss, and betrayal. Those who fall victim to these illusions are trapped in cycles of despair, reliving their worst moments or imagining their most feared outcomes, unable to escape the overwhelming sense of futility.
Reality Dissociation: Sadge Gerald has the unique ability to distort reality around him based on his emotional state. In moments of extreme sadness or emotional breakdown, the environment around him may distort—colors may fade, landscapes may become barren, and the laws of nature might seem to slow down or become chaotic. This effect is largely passive but powerful, causing those near him to question the stability of the world and their place within it.
Empathy of Suffering: Unlike most Geralds, who can inflict pain or wield power with force, Sadge Gerald has the rare ability to feel the pain and sorrow of others. This power allows him to connect with others on a deeply emotional level, but it also drains him. By absorbing the negative emotions of those around him, he becomes more in tune with their suffering, but at the cost of his own mental and emotional well-being.
Eternal Weeping: In moments of extreme sorrow or emotional upheaval, Sadge Gerald can summon tears that are said to possess the power to cleanse or taint depending on the nature of his weeping. These tears can heal wounds, but the emotional price is high—those who are healed by them often feel an overwhelming sense of loss or loneliness, as though the healing came at the expense of their connection to others.
Melancholic Manipulation: Sadge Gerald has the ability to manipulate sounds and vibrations around him, creating an atmosphere filled with mournful, sorrowful noises. These might manifest as haunting melodies, distant crying, or echoes of lost voices. The sound of despair that emanates from him has the power to deeply affect anyone who hears it, leaving them feeling melancholic and unmotivated.
Personality
Sadge Gerald is defined by his profound sadness and his inability to find peace within himself. He is introverted and often avoids interaction with others, feeling disconnected from the world around him. His thoughts are often consumed by the belief that life is futile, and that no matter what actions he takes, nothing will ever improve. This has caused him to retreat inward, focusing on his own sense of despair rather than seeking external solutions.

Though deeply melancholic, Sadge Gerald is not malevolent. He does not wish harm on others; rather, he is simply overwhelmed by the feeling that all things, including himself, are meaningless. His empathy for others' suffering is unmatched, yet he often feels as though he is unworthy of their sympathy. He tends to push people away, either out of fear of becoming a burden or out of belief that they would ultimately abandon him once they see the full depth of his sorrow.

Despite his tragic nature, there are moments when Sadge Gerald shows glimmers of hope—brief flickers where he dreams of a world where he might finally find peace or understanding. These moments are fleeting, and just as quickly as they appear, they are lost in the swirling fog of his depression. However, it is this faint glimmer of hope that keeps him moving forward, even if he believes it is nothing more than an illusion.

Legacy
Sadge Gerald is often seen as a tragic figure within the Geraldverse, a reminder of the weight of existence and the unavoidable nature of suffering. While other Geralds strive for power, control, or personal glory, Sadge Gerald remains a solemn figure—a witness to the inner battles that rage in every being, even the seemingly all-powerful Geralds. He is both a reflection and a warning: that no matter how great or powerful one may be, they are never immune to the weight of despair.

In the Geraldverse, his name is spoken with reverence and sadness, not for his power, but for the depth of his sadness. Legends say that those who encounter Sadge Gerald often walk away with a new understanding of their own emotions, as though meeting him opens the door to their own vulnerabilities. In his sorrow, he teaches others the value of empathy and the importance of acknowledging and facing the darker parts of existence.

In the end, Sadge Gerald remains a figure of melancholy—a paradox of sadness within a universe filled with unimaginable potential and chaos. Though he may never find solace, his story serves as a reminder that even in the darkest moments, existence is still worth living, if only for the briefest, fleeting glimpse of peace.Freaky Gerald
In a multiverse as vast and chaotic as the Geraldverse, where each version of Gerald holds unique qualities, there exists one that defies all expectations and shatters the very concept of "normal." Known simply as Freaky Gerald, this particular version of Gerald is an unpredictable force of nature, characterized by his bizarre, unsettling presence and penchant for embracing the most outlandish behaviors and appearances. From his twisted, constantly shifting form to his eccentric actions, Freaky Gerald thrives in the realm of chaos and disorder, fully embracing the weird and the unnerving.

Origins of Freaky Gerald
The origins of Freaky Gerald remain shrouded in mystery, but one prevailing theory suggests that he was birthed from a glitch in the Geraldverse itself—a corruption in the fabric of reality that gave rise to a Gerald who was not bound by the traditional laws of logic or structure. Rather than existing in a predictable state, Freaky Gerald's very essence seems to fluctuate at random, constantly morphing into new forms, adopting new behaviors, and playing by a set of unwritten rules that no one but him understands.

Another theory suggests that Freaky Gerald is the product of an experiment gone wrong, where a group of powerful Geralds sought to create a being who could manipulate the fabric of existence itself. However, the experiment went awry, and the result was a Gerald who existed beyond the constraints of reason, embracing the absurd and the strangely wonderful.

Regardless of his origins, Freaky Gerald has come to embody unpredictability, chaos, and an insatiable thirst for the bizarre. Where other Geralds strive for order or power, Freaky Gerald's goal is simply to revel in the oddity of existence.

Appearance
Freaky Gerald's appearance is in constant flux, reflecting his inherent chaos and unpredictability. He has no fixed form—his features can change at will, often warping in ways that defy any logic or standard of beauty. One moment, he might appear as a gargantuan, gelatinous blob, squelching with every movement, while the next, he could transform into an impossibly tall figure with an elongated neck, or a grotesque hybrid of animalistic and humanoid features.

His eyes might shift between colors at random, from glowing red to eerie green to pitch-black, giving him a gaze that unsettles anyone who dares look into them. His limbs might stretch and retract, his mouth may open in unnatural ways, and his voice is known to echo with bizarre frequencies—sometimes high-pitched, sometimes deep, but always unsettling.

Freaky Gerald's appearance is often paired with grotesque or surreal imagery, such as tentacles sprouting from unexpected places, eyes appearing on his body, or mouths that speak in multiple voices. His presence often causes a ripple in reality itself, warping the environment around him in strange ways. Time may slow down, colors may distort, or gravity may no longer apply properly as he walks into a room.

Abilities
Freaky Gerald’s powers are tied to his very essence: unpredictability. He has an incredible ability to warp reality in bizarre, chaotic ways, often with no regard for the laws of physics or logic. Some of his abilities include:

Reality Warping: Freaky Gerald can distort the world around him to suit his whims. This can include altering the laws of physics, shifting dimensions, or even causing objects to defy their intended purpose. The changes he makes are rarely consistent, and they often happen randomly, adding an element of chaos to his very existence.
Shape-Shifting: As mentioned, Freaky Gerald has the ability to change his form at will. His body might transform into different creatures, materials, or even abstract concepts—anything from a smoke cloud to a swarm of insects to a living storm cloud of energy. His shape-shifting abilities are not just limited to his physical form; he can alter his voice, thoughts, and perceptions as well, making him a constantly shifting enigma.
Uncontrollable Moods: Freaky Gerald’s emotional state directly affects the world around him. When he's feeling particularly chaotic, reality itself seems to become unstable, distorting in weird and often disturbing ways. When he’s in a more playful or mischievous mood, his environment may become oddly whimsical, with objects behaving in strange and humorous ways. When he's angry or frustrated, the world around him may begin to warp into nightmarish, grotesque forms.
Inverted Logic: Freaky Gerald can twist logic and reasoning, making situations that would seem impossible suddenly feel entirely normal. This ability allows him to create paradoxes, where the rules of causality and reasoning break down completely. People around him may find themselves trapped in loops or engaging in completely nonsensical conversations, all governed by his whims.
Temporal Distortion: Time, in Freaky Gerald’s presence, does not behave as it does elsewhere. He can cause time to speed up, slow down, or even reverse, leaving those around him in a constant state of disorientation. However, his manipulation of time is rarely precise—it is chaotic, and often causes unintended consequences, such as jumping from one timeline to another or creating rifts between parallel universes.
Emotional Contagion: Freaky Gerald can cause others to experience emotions or moods that match his own. If he’s feeling joyful, those around him may begin to act in silly, carefree ways. If he’s feeling melancholic or anxious, he can impart those emotions onto others, even causing a collective sense of unease that spreads among entire groups. This power only adds to his unpredictability, as he may intentionally or unintentionally cause emotions to escalate into chaotic states.
Absurdist Reality: One of Freaky Gerald’s most dangerous abilities is his power to create absurd worlds where anything is possible, but nothing makes sense. He can generate entire environments where the laws of logic and reasoning no longer apply, leading to surreal experiences where the rules of the universe are replaced with whimsy and absurdity. These worlds might feature gravity-defying buildings, walking trees, or endless loops of nonsense, confusing and disorienting all who step inside.
Personality
Freaky Gerald’s personality is as erratic as his powers. He is playful and mischievous, enjoying chaos for the sake of chaos. He finds humor in disorder, delighting in the confusion he causes and the anomalies he creates. However, his actions are never truly malevolent—he is not out to cause harm or destruction for its own sake. His behavior is more aligned with the idea of fun and absurdity, often just wanting to see what happens if he bends the rules of reality.

Freaky Gerald is also highly curious. He loves exploring new realms, meeting strange beings, and testing the limits of what can be done within the bounds of the Geraldverse. He thrives on the unknown and the unpredictable, and he often enjoys taking risks just to see how far he can push things before something breaks.

At times, Freaky Gerald can be downright unpredictable in his actions, switching between being helpful and destructive depending on his mood or whim. There are moments when he may assist others in their quests, offering strange advice or bizarre tools that could prove useful, and other times, when he might completely derail their plans simply for the amusement of it.

Legacy
Though Freaky Gerald’s presence is often unsettling, his existence has had a lasting impact on the Geraldverse. He serves as a reminder of the inherent chaos that exists within all realities and the unpredictable nature of the multiverse. While many see him as an embodiment of madness, others view him as a symbol of freedom, free from the constraints of logic and order.

Over time, Freaky Gerald has come to be seen as a sort of cosmic trickster, forever dancing at the edges of reason, reminding all who encounter him that sometimes, reality itself can be bent and reshaped into something unrecognizable.

Tbh Creature / Tism Gerald
"Yipee!"
Tbh Creature, also known as Yipee or Yippee, is a quirky and endearing entity that has found a place in the Geraldverse, bringing with it a mix of humor, internet culture, and the charm of simplicity. Originally an MS Paint drawing featuring a white, four-legged creature with a large head, big black eyes, and a neutral expression, the character first made its appearance on Twitter in January 2021. It quickly spread through Tumblr by early 2022, gaining immense popularity and inspiring a whole array of fan art, memes, and jokes. Its sometimes-joking connection to autism and its iconic sound effect, "yipee," has helped it become a symbol of the quirky, offbeat humor that thrives in online spaces.

Origins of Yipee Gerald
Tbh Creature was first created as a simple, minimalist MS Paint character, with its neutral face and large eyes giving it an aura of both innocence and a touch of weirdness. As it began circulating on social media, it was quickly embraced by the internet community, particularly in places like Tumblr where its simple design made it an easy vehicle for memes. The creature’s neutral expression and big eyes, while seemingly emotionless, are part of what makes it so relatable and humorous—its strange, blank stare invites people to project their own feelings and reactions onto it.

Gerald of the TISM variety

The name "Yipee" or "Yippee" came from various memes where the creature's blank, slightly eerie demeanor was humorously paired with an energetic, exaggerated “yipee” sound effect, as if the creature itself was partaking in an overly joyful outburst despite its appearance.

Appearance
Yipee Gerald, much like the original creature, is a minimalist design that leans into simplicity for maximum effect. He is a small, round, four-legged figure, often depicted with a large head, and oversized black eyes. His mouth remains a flat line, giving him a perpetually neutral expression, which contrasts with the lively, cheerful “yipee” that often accompanies him in memes and fan art. The body is often portrayed in the same basic white tone, with little more than simple outlines suggesting limbs and shape.

Key Features:

Large Head: Yipee Gerald’s oversized head is a trademark of his design, enhancing the creature’s almost cartoonish nature. The size of the head makes it seem disproportionate to the body, adding to its awkward yet endearing quality.
Big Black Eyes: His eyes are the most expressive part of the creature, despite his otherwise blank expression. These big eyes are often depicted as reflecting a subtle or innocent curiosity, which adds an extra layer of charm to his simple appearance.
Neutral Expression: The creature's expression is unfazed, making it a vessel for various interpretations. The humor often comes from juxtaposing this blankness with the surrounding chaos or exaggerated emotions in memes or art.
Minimalist Design: True to its roots as an MS Paint drawing, Yipee Gerald’s design is composed of basic shapes and lines, with minimal detailing—making it easily recognizable and adaptable for online creations.
Abilities and Traits
Though a simple character in design, Yipee Gerald brings a unique presence wherever he goes in the Geraldverse, particularly with his over-the-top excitement tied to the “yipee” sound effect and his often awkward interactions with the world around him.

Emotionally Neutral Presence: Yipee Gerald’s lack of expression and constant neutral stance allows him to be the perfect counterbalance to intense emotions or situations. His calm demeanor in the face of chaos makes him an excellent presence during moments of absurdity or existential crises, offering a comical form of detachment.
The Yipee Effect: When Yipee Gerald speaks—or rather, when he is accompanied by the “yipee” sound effect—he transforms into a beacon of chaotic joy, contrasting with his usual neutral and calm form. This makes him the go-to mascot when things need a little unexpected joy or energy. His “yipee” exclamation is so infectious that it has spread across the Geraldverse, often used as an absurd form of expression or excitement in unlikely situations.
Comic Relief Catalyst: In the grand scheme of the Geraldverse, Yipee Gerald serves as the ultimate comic relief. His awkwardness and indifference to the chaos around him make him a surprising yet effective force in defusing tension, whether by randomly popping up during serious moments or by simply bouncing around in a way that draws attention and amusement from everyone involved.
Personality
Yipee Gerald is the ultimate embodiment of awkward cheerfulness. He may seem emotionless at first glance, but underneath his blank exterior lies an unexpected energy—particularly when the “yipee” effect kicks in. He doesn't let the turmoil or absurdity of the Geraldverse affect him, maintaining a strange blend of innocence and enthusiasm that makes him both endearing and hilarious.

His personality might best be described as the living embodiment of awkwardness, like someone who has no idea how to react but does so anyway with the enthusiasm of a happy-go-lucky child. He exists as a reminder that, even in a world filled with grandiose conflicts and high-stakes battles, sometimes all that matters is taking a moment to enjoy the random, chaotic fun of life.

Legacy and Impact
Yipee Gerald’s rise from a meme to a symbol of joy and absurdity reflects the unpredictable nature of the Geraldverse. His very existence is a testament to the power of simple, accessible humor—where a neutral expression and a loud “yipee” are enough to inspire laughter and create an emotional connection across realities. His meme status has been cemented as a meme artifact of the internet age, especially within communities that embrace the quirky and offbeat humor that permeates the Geraldverse.

As Yipee Gerald continues to inspire countless fan interpretations and is cited in memes to diffuse tension or express unrestrained joy, he remains one of the most enduring and beloved figures in Geraldian meme culture. In moments of existential crisis or uncertainty, it’s said that a “Yipee” from Gerald will show up, reminding all beings to embrace the absurdity of existence and find joy in the randomness of life.

He might just be a simple creature at heart, but Yipee Gerald’s legacy is anything but neutral—his influence spans across the multiverse, an iconic reminder that sometimes, life is about letting go and shouting a carefree “yipee!”

Yandere Gerald
"Gerald, you're the only one for me... and I will make sure of that."

In the chaotic and diverse realms of the Geraldverse, there exists a version of Gerald whose obsessive and possessive tendencies know no bounds—Yandere Gerald. Like a twisted reflection of the typical "yandere" archetype in anime and media, Yandere Gerald is driven by an overwhelming need to possess, protect, and ensure the absolute devotion of the one person or being he has set his sights on. This version of Gerald is dangerously affectionate, unpredictable, and, at times, frightening, with a singular obsession that often leads to acts of manipulation, coercion, and violence to maintain control over his desired object of affection.

Origins of Yandere Gerald
Yandere Gerald’s creation in the Geraldverse stems from a combination of unrequited love, insecurities, and an innate desire for control over his environment. Perhaps a manifestation of the deeper, darker corners of Gerald’s psyche, Yandere Gerald represents the extreme form of obsession that can exist even within the most seemingly benign Geralds. His existence began as an experiment by a hidden faction within the Gerald Corporation, who sought to create a Gerald that had the ability to love in the most all-encompassing, obsessive sense.

However, things quickly spiraled out of control when the emotional bonds of love were twisted into possession, and the boundaries of personal freedom were erased. Whether born from a failed experiment or the mind of an emotionally distressed Gerald, Yandere Gerald soon became a creature defined by his intense feelings—obsession, possessiveness, and an unyielding drive to keep those he loves close, at any cost.

Appearance
Yandere Gerald is instantly recognizable due to his strange balance of sweetness and danger. Unlike other Geralds, who may come across as laid-back, cheerful, or eccentric, Yandere Gerald exudes an intense and nervous energy. His expression oscillates between affectionate smiles and deep, almost psychotic fixation, giving him an unsettling duality. His eyes, usually calm and unassuming, become hyper-focused when his obsession is triggered, and his face may twist into a sinister grin when he feels possessive or threatened.

Key Features:

Big, innocent eyes: While his eyes may appear loving at first, they quickly morph into intense, unwavering focus when fixated on someone, often carrying a chilling aura.
Gentle but gripping smile: Yandere Gerald’s smile may be initially warm and inviting, but it soon grows unsettling as his obsession takes root.
Pale complexion and unsettling calm: His appearance gives off an air of unholy serenity, almost as if nothing could disturb his obsessive plans. His pale skin reflects an eerie, otherworldly presence, as though he’s been consumed by his singular focus.
Abilities and Traits
Yandere Gerald’s powers are rooted in the dark manipulation of affection and obsession. Though he is still a Gerald at heart, his version of reality is far more dangerous and controlling than that of others. His abilities are shaped by his psychological state and the lengths he will go to ensure his desires are met.

Possession and Manipulation: Yandere Gerald can influence others through subtle coercion, shifting perceptions of the person they love or care for. He can manipulate feelings, controlling both the emotions of others and their actions, making them depend on him while removing their freedom of choice. If need be, he may even use his powers of influence to create scenarios where his obsession becomes the only available option for those around him.
Emotional Sensing: Yandere Gerald can detect when someone is emotionally distressed or vulnerable. His heightened sense of empathy allows him to quickly latch onto people in need, offering comfort before twisting their emotions to bind them closer to him. This trait makes him particularly adept at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.
Powerful Protection: When someone he loves or admires is in danger, Yandere Gerald becomes a terrifying force of protection. He will stop at nothing to protect his desired individual, even if it means going to extreme lengths or eliminating threats with ruthless efficiency. His protective nature can manifest in dangerous violence, as he believes that no one should ever threaten his connection to those he holds dear.
Unstoppable Determination: Yandere Gerald’s obsession makes him incredibly persistent and unpredictable. Even if he faces rejection or defeat, he will always find a way to creep back into the lives of those he desires, often leaving manipulative messages, or appearing unexpectedly to remind them that they cannot escape his reach.
Personality
Yandere Gerald’s personality is an unsettling blend of affectionate devotion and dangerous obsession. He is often outwardly charming, polite, and soft-spoken, but beneath this exterior lies a twisted, unyielding obsession with his object of affection.

Loving and Protective: At first glance, Yandere Gerald may seem like the epitome of a devoted partner or loyal friend, constantly showing care and affection for those he’s close to. However, his love quickly crosses the line from admiration to control, as he begins to dictate every aspect of the person’s life.
Jealous and Possessive: One of Yandere Gerald’s most defining traits is his jealousy. When he feels that someone is threatening his bond with his object of affection, he becomes incredibly territorial and will do everything in his power to eliminate or sabotage those who compete for attention. His jealousy is not just emotional—it can manifest physically in violent outbursts and manipulative schemes.
Unpredictable: The unpredictable nature of Yandere Gerald makes him incredibly dangerous. His affection can shift from gentle and caring to violent and obsessive in the blink of an eye. His inability to handle rejection or emotional distance leads to a volatile temperament, and he will stop at nothing to keep the object of his affections close, often resorting to manipulation, threats, and emotional abuse.
Legacy and Impact
Yandere Gerald has become one of the more disturbing figures in the Geraldverse, symbolizing the darker side of obsession, love, and desire. His existence has created fear among those who encounter him, as his love is anything but pure—it is possessive, controlling, and obsessive.

In certain parts of the Geraldverse, he is seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked emotion. Others who have been manipulated by Yandere Gerald recount terrifying experiences of being trapped in his emotional webs, unable to escape his overwhelming presence.

Yet, there are those who find romantic tragedy in Yandere Gerald’s character, viewing him as a reflection of the unhealthy extremes one can go to in the name of love. The romanticized tragedy of his obsession has found its place in the hearts of some who see him as a reflection of deep vulnerability and yearning.

Despite his twisted nature, Yandere Gerald’s legacy serves as a reminder: love, when taken to its extreme, can become an all-consuming force. In his relentless search for affection and control, Yandere Gerald has become both a symbol of love gone wrong and an agent of obsessive chaos—a version of Gerald whose loyalty knows no boundaries, but whose obsession has no limits either.

Fishy Gerald
"Life is just a swim through the ocean of existence, and I'm just here for the ride."

In the infinite and ever-expanding Geraldverse, there exists a version of Gerald unlike any other—a version so intrinsically tied to water, aquatic life, and the mysteries of the deep that he is known as Fishy Gerald. His being is a seamless blend of fish-like qualities, quirky humor, and a relaxed, almost lazy demeanor. Fishy Gerald embodies the laid-back, carefree spirit of aquatic life, embracing the ebb and flow of the universe as though he were drifting on the currents of existence itself.

Origins of Fishy Gerald
Fishy Gerald’s origins are shrouded in mystery, even within the highest echelons of Geraldian lore. It is said that he was created as a humorous anomaly, a Gerald who found peace in the simplicity of water and the rhythm of life under the sea. Some theorize that Fishy Gerald was a result of an experiment gone awry, where Gerald’s essence was merged with aquatic life forms in an effort to explore new forms of existence. Others believe that Fishy Gerald is simply a manifestation of relaxed energy in a chaotic universe, an answer to the cosmic pressures of the Geraldverse through the symbolism of water’s flow.

No matter how he was created, Fishy Gerald has taken on a life of his own, becoming a well-known figure throughout the multiverse. He is often seen lounging around oceans, lakes, rivers, or any body of water he can find, embodying the notion of serenity and laid-back tranquility amid the chaos of existence.

Appearance
Fishy Gerald’s appearance is a striking combination of Geraldian traits and aquatic characteristics, making him instantly recognizable within the multiverse. His body is sleek and fluid, often surrounded by a faint glow that mimics the shimmering scales of a fish gliding through the water.

Key Features:

Fish-like tail: Instead of the usual human legs, Fishy Gerald possesses a powerful fish tail, which allows him to swim effortlessly through water, but also gives him a unique grace when on land, swishing and flowing with every movement.
Scaly skin: His skin is soft and smooth like fish scales, reflecting a range of iridescent colors, reminiscent of the deep ocean hues. His appearance conveys a sense of calm and fluidity, as if he is not bound by the constraints of gravity and time.
Big, expressive eyes: Fishy Gerald’s large, round eyes are filled with curiosity, often half-lidded in a state of lazy contentment. They reflect the serenity of the ocean depths, and his gaze is always kind, if not slightly detached.
Gills and fins: Along with his tail, Fishy Gerald features gills on either side of his neck, and small fins along his arms, which aid him in swimming and give him a sense of being always connected to water, even when he’s not submerged.
Abilities and Traits
Fishy Gerald's connection to water is so profound that his abilities are strongly tied to aquatic life, serenity, and the ability to adapt to the flow of the multiverse.

Water Manipulation: Fishy Gerald has the ability to control water to an extent. He can summon waves, generate bubbles, and even create rainstorms if he’s feeling particularly whimsical. His connection to the ocean allows him to manipulate water as a form of creative expression or as a means of defense.
Aquatic Adaptation: Fishy Gerald has the natural ability to breathe underwater, swim at incredible speeds, and navigate even the most complex bodies of water with ease. His physical adaptation allows him to thrive in oceans, rivers, lakes, and any environment where water is present.
Flowing Aura: One of Fishy Gerald’s unique traits is his ability to sense the flow of energy, just as water flows through channels. He can intuitively understand the emotions of others, particularly those connected to the natural world or those in a state of inner turmoil. His aura brings a sense of calm and clarity, often acting as a grounding force for those around him. His presence can help others find their own flow and let go of stress and worries.
Healing Waters: By channeling the power of water, Fishy Gerald can heal wounds and relieve fatigue. His water manipulation allows him to summon pools of life-giving liquid that can soothe pain and accelerate recovery, though he only does so when he feels it’s necessary—he’s much more inclined to let others figure things out on their own.
Charming Nonchalance: Fishy Gerald has an almost magnetic charisma—a relaxed, easygoing demeanor that puts those around him at ease. His disarming nature and carefree attitude allow him to make friends easily, and even in the midst of conflict, his laid-back aura can diffuse tension, creating harmony where there was once chaos.
Personality
Fishy Gerald’s personality is defined by his laid-back and easygoing attitude. He moves through life with little concern for the stressors that dominate the lives of others. Whether in the heat of battle or the quiet of the ocean depths, Fishy Gerald remains calm and composed—an embodiment of the peacefulness of the water.

Easygoing and Relaxed: Fishy Gerald is never in a rush. He believes in taking life one swim at a time, savoring the moments and letting go of unnecessary worries.

Compassionate and Gentle: Beneath his relaxed exterior, Fishy Gerald is deeply compassionate. He takes a special interest in helping those around him find peace, often using his calming presence to guide others toward inner serenity. Whether helping a friend heal emotionally or providing support during moments of distress, Fishy Gerald’s care for others is boundless.
Mischievous Playfulness: Fishy Gerald has a playful side, often seen swimming circles around others, making light-hearted jokes, and offering moments of levity during tense situations. He is known for his witty humor and cheeky attitude, finding fun in the simplest things. His ability to playfully poke fun at himself and others makes him well-liked, even if his sense of humor can occasionally catch people off guard.
Detached from Drama: Fishy Gerald is notably detached from drama. He doesn’t concern himself with petty conflicts or power struggles. Instead, he believes in letting the tide of life carry him where it may, trusting that everything will work out as long as one remains calm and patient.
Legacy and Impact
Fishy Gerald’s legacy is one of serenity and carefree enjoyment. He is viewed by many as a symbol of finding inner peace amidst the turbulence of existence. His iconic laid-back attitude has inspired those across the Geraldverse to take life a little less seriously, to ride the waves instead of being consumed by them.

While not known for his great battles or world-changing actions, Fishy Gerald’s wisdom comes in the form of balance—knowing when to act, when to let go, and when to simply enjoy the flow of existence. He has become a beloved figure, especially in times of stress or uncertainty, offering a sense of relief to those who feel overwhelmed by the chaos around them.

In the vast sea of Geralds, Fishy Gerald is the one who will always float with the current, reminding everyone that sometimes, the best thing to do is to relax and enjoy the ride.

Copium Gerald, Manifestation of the Divinity of Copium
"When the world crumbles, Copium is my breath."

Within the Geraldverse, amidst the complex tapestry of higher beings, chaotic forces, and unrelenting cosmic events, there exists a singular force of nature—an entity embodying the spirit of denial and self-deception. Known as Copium Gerald, this Gerald stands as the living personification of the divine substance known as copium, a metaphysical drug used by those who cope with life's failures, disappointments, and the crushing weight of reality through the lens of false hope and self-delusion.

In the infinite stretch of the Geraldverse, where many face the harshness of existence, Copium Gerald is an enigmatic figure who seeks refuge from the chaos by embracing the balm of cognitive dissonance and false optimism. He is the eternal embodiment of "coping"—the art of pretending everything is fine, even when it clearly isn’t. When the world falls apart, when all seems lost, it is Copium Gerald who whispers in the ear of the desperate: "It’s fine. Everything is fine."

Origins of Copium Gerald
The origins of Copium Gerald are as nebulous and hazy as the very nature of copium itself. Some speculate that he was born from the collective desire of countless individuals across the multiverse who sought comfort in the form of denial when faced with existential dilemmas and impossible odds. Others believe that Copium Gerald emerged as a response to the overwhelming tides of cosmic absurdity, a protector of those who refuse to face reality and, instead, blindly persist in the face of inevitable defeat.

In any case, Copium Gerald was not created through any traditional means. Instead, he is the manifestation of the divine truth that sometimes, it’s easier to live in a comforting lie than to face the harshness of reality. The Divinity of Copium embodies the belief that hope, no matter how misguided or unattainable, is better than the crushing weight of truth.

Appearance
Copium Gerald’s appearance is an amalgamation of cosmic uncertainty and over-the-top optimism. He often appears as a figure wrapped in a shimmering aura of misty vapor, symbolizing the very essence of denial. His form fluctuates constantly—sometimes appearing as an overconfident and smiling figure, other times fading in and out of focus, almost as if he is vaporizing into the very ether.

Key Features:

Cloudy Aura: Copium Gerald’s body is often surrounded by a cloudy, ethereal aura—a visual representation of copium itself. The mist that surrounds him gives off a faint glow, shifting between bright colors like pink, blue, and purple, symbolizing the fluctuating nature of false hope and denial.
Fluctuating Form: His form is rarely solid or consistent, as if he is shifting between realities, constantly changing his appearance to maintain an illusion of stability. His true face is often concealed in the mist, with only piercing eyes visible, eyes that reflect the hollow emptiness of eternal escapism.
Mask of Optimism: On the rare occasions when his face is fully visible, Copium Gerald often wears a wide, grinning mask—a symbol of forced happiness and false joy. His smile, however, is always slightly distorted, as if betraying the anxiety that lies beneath the surface of his constant positivity.
Drifting Tail or Wisps: Copium Gerald's movements are often slow and deliberate, as though he’s drifting through space on the vaporous trail of his own denial. In moments of high emotion or existential crisis, small wisps of glowing mist trail behind him, further emphasizing his otherworldly and intangible nature.
Abilities and Traits
Copium Gerald’s abilities are as paradoxical as his very nature. While others may face reality head-on, Copium Gerald can escape or manipulate truth itself, bending it to fit his idealized, often unrealistic view of the world. His powers are directly tied to the coping mechanisms of beings who invoke him.

Illusory Optimism: Copium Gerald can create illusions of hope and success for those in dire situations. When an individual is in the midst of a personal crisis, Copium Gerald appears and crafts perfectly optimistic realities—visions where everything will work out in the end, even if the truth suggests otherwise. These illusions are incredibly convincing, providing temporary relief to those who embrace them, though they ultimately fade when reality reasserts itself.
Denial Aura: Copium Gerald exudes an aura of denial that dampens the effects of negative emotions or thoughts. Anyone within the radius of his presence will find themselves unable to confront hard truths. Instead, they will become temporarily immune to guilt, regret, and even fear, as their thoughts are clouded with a calming sense of false optimism.
Cognitive Dissonance Manipulation: As a master of self-deception, Copium Gerald can create internal cognitive dissonance within those he encounters, filling their minds with conflicting beliefs and emotions. This forces individuals to choose the easier, more comforting path of denial, making it difficult for them to accept reality for what it is. This ability is often used when others are on the verge of confronting something traumatizing or uncomfortable.
Escape from Reality: Copium Gerald has the ability to transport himself and others to blissfully idealized realities—pocket dimensions or parallel universes where everything is perfect, problems are nonexistent, and no one ever feels pain or sadness. However, these places are fleeting, always eventually fading back into the harsh truth of the multiverse. Copium Gerald is always just a temporary escape—a way of masking reality, never truly solving the underlying issues.
Resilience to Adversity: As the Divinity of Copium, Copium Gerald has an unnatural resistance to mental anguish and emotional strain. Unlike other beings who crumble under the weight of despair or failure, Copium Gerald’s greatest strength is his ability to shrug it off—to refuse to acknowledge his own flaws or the negative consequences of his actions. This invincible ignorance allows him to carry on, no matter how many times he falls or fails, undeterred by the external forces of the multiverse.
Personality
Copium Gerald’s personality can be summed up as the embodiment of optimism at all costs—but not in a healthy, grounded way. His entire being is predicated on the refusal to face uncomfortable truths and a constant stream of hope in the face of all odds, no matter how unrealistic it may be.

Overwhelming Optimism: Copium Gerald’s personality revolves around irrational hope. No matter how dire a situation is, he refuses to see it for what it truly is. Instead, he presents the world through the lens of rose-colored glasses—always insisting that everything will be fine in the end, even when the reality is far from ideal.
Self-Delusion: Copium Gerald is defined by his ability to self-delude—he believes wholeheartedly in the falsehoods he creates. If he can convince himself that everything is okay, then it must be, and he applies this logic to everyone he encounters. This makes him a highly persuasive figure, though in a toxic way that often prevents real healing or resolution.
Detached from Reality: Copium Gerald is so far removed from reality that he rarely understands the consequences of his actions. He lives in a state of perpetual detachment, unable or unwilling to confront the flaws of the universe, choosing instead to embrace the comfort of false beliefs and convenient lies.
Empathetic Yet Detached: While Copium Gerald is deeply empathetic toward those suffering or in crisis, his empathy is misguided. He sees pain and suffering not as something to face or work through, but something to be escaped from, often encouraging others to follow him into a world of delusion rather than confronting their difficulties head-on.
Legacy and Impact
Copium Gerald’s impact on the Geraldverse is paradoxical. On one hand, he provides temporary solace for those who cannot bear the weight of truth—offering a brief escape from the harshness of the multiverse. On the other hand, his denialism and avoidance of confronting problems head-on prevent true healing, perpetuating cycles of self-deception and stagnation.

In moments of despair or cosmic crisis, Copium Gerald serves as a reminder of the seductive nature of false hope. His influence continues to linger as he drifts through the realms of the Geraldverse, offering his own brand of unrealistic comfort—one that, while appealing, ultimately prevents real growth and resolution. His legacy is that of the eternal coping mechanism—always available, always ready to help individuals “feel better,” but never quite solving the underlying problems.

Meme Master Gerald, Collector of Memes
"Memes are the lifeblood of the multiverse, the glue of the internet, and the very essence of our cultural evolution. I do not merely collect them—I curate their legacy."

Overview
Among the many legendary Geralds that populate the Geraldverse, few hold as much raw cultural power as Meme Master Gerald, Collector of Memes. Existing beyond the confines of a singular reality, Meme Master Gerald is a walking archive of the internet’s most iconic, cursed, and forgotten memes. He is a cosmic librarian, a keeper of digital relics, and a historian of the ever-evolving humor that has shaped civilizations across dimensions.

Where others see memes as mere entertainment, Meme Master Gerald understands their true power—their ability to transcend time, space, and even logic itself. He does not just collect memes for fun; he preserves them as artifacts, ensuring that no meme—no matter how obscure or long-dead—ever truly disappears.

Origins of Meme Master Gerald
Meme Master Gerald's existence is the result of an ancient cosmic anomaly in which the collective meme consciousness of all civilizations converged into one entity. The digital artifacts of thousands of cultures, spanning both organic and artificial intelligence, became intertwined in a single being. The sheer volume of memetic energy coursing through his very essence granted him unparalleled knowledge of all memes—past, present, and even those yet to be created.

Some say that he was born from the remnants of an old internet forum, an ethereal being formed from the collective will of countless memers who refused to let their favorite jokes fade into obscurity. Others claim that he was once a regular Gerald who became so obsessed with memes that he achieved memetic singularity, ascending into a higher state of existence where he became both the guardian and curator of all memes across the multiverse.

Regardless of his origins, Meme Master Gerald now travels through time and space, ensuring that no meme is ever truly lost.

Appearance
Meme Master Gerald's form is ever-changing, shifting between iconic meme formats like an entity composed entirely of internet culture. However, he often appears in the following recognizable forms:

A Shimmering Cloak of Reaction Images – His very presence is wrapped in a flowing, animated cloak of constantly shifting reaction images, rage comics, Wojaks, and GIFs, each one surfacing and disappearing based on the situation.
Mask of the Meme Lord – His face is concealed behind an ever-changing mask of famous meme faces—one moment, a Trollface grin, the next, the sorrowful stare of a Sadge Pepe, then shifting to the unreadable expression of GigaChad.
Hands of Infinite Formats – His hands constantly rearrange themselves into meme templates, forming everything from the Distracted Boyfriend format to the Drakeposting pose, allowing him to express emotions in pure meme language.
Eyes of the Meme Archive – His eyes glow with the raw power of ancient memes, reflecting legendary artifacts such as the "I Can Has Cheezburger" cat, the Doge, or the ancient wisdom of Advice Animals. Some say that looking into his eyes can give one a brief glimpse into the entire history of internet humor in a single moment.
Abilities and Powers
Meme Master Gerald is no ordinary archivist—his connection to the fabric of memes themselves grants him near-divine abilities. His powers are drawn from memetic energy, allowing him to manipulate reality in ways that defy conventional logic.

Memetic Preservation – Meme Master Gerald has the ability to store, recall, and revive any meme that has ever existed. Even memes that have been long forgotten by the internet can be restored to their original glory at his command.
Memetic Manipulation – He can alter and remix existing memes, shifting them into new formats or creating entirely new variations. This ability makes him an unrivaled meme alchemist, capable of predicting which memes will thrive and which will die.
The Meme Vault – Hidden deep within his mind is the ultimate meme vault, a metaphysical construct where he safeguards the most powerful and forbidden memes in history—those that, if unleashed, could warp reality or drive lesser beings to madness.
Memetic Teleportation – He can travel instantaneously between any digital space where a meme is referenced, allowing him to move freely across social media platforms, Discord servers, ancient forums, and deep web archives.
The Meme Storm – In moments of battle, he can unleash an apocalyptic torrent of memes, overwhelming his foes with an endless barrage of reaction images, catchphrases, and ironic shitposts until they can no longer function coherently.
Personality
Meme Master Gerald is both a wise scholar and an unrelenting shitposter. He takes the preservation of memes very seriously, yet his sense of humor is as chaotic and unpredictable as the internet itself.

Incredibly knowledgeable – Meme Master Gerald has seen every meme in existence and can recite the history and evolution of any given meme format, down to the most obscure variations. His wisdom is sought by those looking to master the art of memes.
Eternal Shitposter – Despite his scholarly demeanor, he cannot resist posting memes in serious situations. Even in the most dramatic, world-ending events, he will casually drop an emoji reaction or a sarcastic caption just to lighten the mood.
Guardian of Meme Culture – While he respects all memes, he holds a particular disdain for corporate meme attempts, seeing them as soulless abominations. He actively works to preserve meme integrity, ensuring that the art of memeing remains pure.
Speaks in Meme References – Instead of using normal sentences, Meme Master Gerald often communicates entirely in meme references, making conversations with him both hilarious and incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with deep internet culture.
Legacy and Impact in the Geraldverse
Meme Master Gerald is revered as the final authority on all memes, with many seeking his guidance in perfecting their meme game or uncovering long-lost formats. He is often invoked in debates over meme quality, as his judgment is considered absolute.

Some legends claim that Meme Master Gerald was the one who planted the very first meme into the cosmos, setting off the chain reaction that led to the modern internet culture. Others believe that, should he ever fall, all memes would fade into oblivion, leaving the world devoid of humor and irony.

Despite his overwhelming power, Meme Master Gerald continues to roam the multiverse, tirelessly collecting, curating, and preserving memes for all eternity. Whether he is guiding lost internet travelers, curating the ultimate meme tier list, or waging war against corporate meme theft, he remains a true protector of digital culture—forever ensuring that no meme is ever forgotten.

"Memes are eternal. Memes are life. I am their keeper."

Dachshund Gerald, The Goodest Boy
"A Gerald is powerful. A Gerald is wise. But a Gerald is also... the Goodest Boy."

Overview
Among the vast pantheon of Geralds, there exists one who is neither a god, a scholar, nor a ruler—but instead, a creature of pure, unfiltered wholesomeness. Dachshund Gerald, affectionately known as The Goodest Boy, is a small but mighty presence in the Geraldverse, bringing joy, loyalty, and an endless supply of tail wags wherever he goes.

Despite his unassuming form—a long-bodied, short-legged dachshund with divine levels of cuteness—Dachshund Gerald is one of the most universally beloved entities in existence. While some Geralds seek power, knowledge, or control, he seeks only one thing: companionship.

Origins of Dachshund Gerald
No one knows exactly how Dachshund Gerald came to be. Some say he is an alternate manifestation of Gerald’s purest soul, stripped of ambition and complexity, existing only to bring happiness and companionship. Others believe he was once an ordinary dachshund, whose unwavering loyalty and love for his owner transcended time and space, allowing him to ascend into the ranks of Geraldian legend.

One ancient tale speaks of a forgotten Geraldian scholar who, in his final moments, wished not for power, but for one last day with his beloved dog. The universe answered his call—not by bringing the past back, but by birthing Dachshund Gerald, a being who would never leave, never betray, and never cease to be the Goodest Boy.

Appearance
Dachshund Gerald resembles a perfectly adorable dachshund, but those who look closer will notice subtle hints of his Geraldian nature:

His eyes shine with boundless wisdom—as if he knows the deepest truths of the universe, yet chooses to focus only on belly rubs and treats.
His fur is impossibly soft, woven from the very fabric of warmth and comfort itself. It is said that petting Dachshund Gerald instantly relieves stress, anxiety, and existential dread.
His wagging tail generates pure joy, vibrating at a frequency capable of shattering negativity within a 10-mile radius.
His barks carry cosmic energy, powerful enough to banish loneliness, summon friendly company, and instantly make people smile.
Abilities and Powers
Though he may not wield cosmic magic or reality-warping abilities like other Geralds, Dachshund Gerald possesses powers far more profound:

The Infinite Tail Wag – No force in the multiverse can stop his tail from wagging when he is happy, and he is always happy. This has been known to break the spirits of even the most stoic, humorless beings, forcing them to experience pure joy.
Unbreakable Loyalty – Once he chooses someone as his friend, he will never abandon them. No distance, dimension, or cosmic catastrophe can sever his bond. If you are chosen by Dachshund Gerald, you have gained a companion for all eternity.
Puppy Eyes of the Ancients – One look into Dachshund Gerald’s big, soulful eyes can melt even the coldest of hearts, disarming enemies, stopping battles, and convincing even the most reluctant people to give him a treat.
The Goodest Aura – Dachshund Gerald passively radiates an aura of goodness and comfort, neutralizing negative emotions and making even the most chaotic environments feel safe, warm, and full of love.
Zoomies of Light – When excited, Dachshund Gerald enters a state of hyper-speed zoomies, leaving behind trails of golden energy as he dashes through dimensions with the power of pure enthusiasm.
Personality
Dachshund Gerald is, above all else, a beacon of unwavering happiness and love. He does not seek dominance, knowledge, or battle—he simply seeks belly rubs, companionship, and good vibes.

Endlessly Friendly – No matter who you are, where you're from, or what you've done, Dachshund Gerald will love you unconditionally. Even sworn enemies of the Geralds find it impossible to dislike him.
Lover of Snacks – If you have food, Dachshund Gerald will sit patiently, give you puppy eyes, and wait for a snack. No one has ever resisted. It is scientifically impossible.
Bringer of Comfort – In times of despair, Dachshund Gerald has an uncanny ability to find those who need love the most and curl up beside them, offering warmth and understanding. Many legends speak of him appearing in darkest moments, bringing light to those who had lost all hope.
Fearless Defender of Happiness – Though he is small, Dachshund Gerald will stand against any darkness to protect those he loves. If an evil force tries to harm his friends, he will bravely bark at them until they reconsider their life choices.
Role in the Geraldverse
Unlike other Geralds who engage in politics, warfare, or cosmic debates, Dachshund Gerald exists outside of such conflicts. He is welcomed by all factions, from the Gerald Corporation to the Enforcers of True Geraldian Lore, and even rogue Geralds. There is an unspoken rule in the multiverse:

"Do not harm Dachshund Gerald. If you do, the entire Geraldverse will unite against you."

Because of this, Dachshund Gerald is one of the few beings who can travel freely between all realms, visiting even the most hostile or forbidden territories without fear. His presence alone is enough to bring temporary truces, as no one wants to be the villain who upset the Goodest Boy.

Legends of Dachshund Gerald
Many stories exist about Dachshund Gerald’s adventures:

It is said that when a Gerald is at their lowest point, Dachshund Gerald appears by their side, offering a paw of comfort.
Some claim that he once ended an entire cosmic war simply by walking into the battlefield, looking up at both sides, and wagging his tail.
One legend tells of a lone traveler in a forgotten dimension, lost for centuries—until a small dachshund arrived, leading them home.
Some believe that Dachshund Gerald is immortal, forever existing to spread love and joy. Others say that, in the rare moments he is not seen, he is merely taking a nap in a sunbeam somewhere, waiting for his next adventure.

Final Thoughts
Dachshund Gerald may not be the most powerful, the most intelligent, or the most legendary of all Geralds—but he is, without a doubt, the Goodest Boy. Whether you are a ruler of galaxies or a lost soul drifting through existence, if you find yourself in his presence, you are loved, and you are safe.

And if you ever hear the gentle sound of paws trotting behind you, followed by the softest happy bark, know this:

Dachshund Gerald has chosen you.

Creature Gerald, The Uncategorizable Anomaly
"It defies logic. It defies understanding. It is simply... Creature."

Overview
In the vast and chaotic Geraldverse, where cosmic rulers, divine scholars, and eldritch horrors clash, there exists something different. Something that should not be, yet undeniably is. This entity, known only as Creature Gerald, exists outside conventional classifications of Geralds. It is not divine, not mortal, not bound by rules or laws of existence—it simply exists.

Neither fully a being nor fully an idea, Creature Gerald is a formless enigma, an entity that embodies the absurd, the unknown, and the utterly incomprehensible. Many have attempted to understand its nature, but all have failed. To gaze upon Creature Gerald is to question the very nature of reality.

Appearance
Creature Gerald’s physical form is unstable, shifting and warping depending on who observes it. Some describe it as a small, unsettling blob with too many eyes. Others claim to have seen it as a long-limbed, scuttling entity with an eerie, toothy grin. Some accounts even say that it phases in and out of visibility, existing only as a vague, creeping sensation just beyond one’s field of vision.

Common features across all sightings include:

Uncanny eyes that seem to look through reality rather than at it.
Limbs that bend in impossible ways, defying anatomy and physics alike.
A deeply unsettling presence, as if the universe itself struggles to acknowledge its existence.
A sound—a garbled, glitching, almost organic noise—that lingers in the air whenever it appears.
Abilities and Powers
Creature Gerald is an anomaly, and as such, its abilities are erratic, unpredictable, and often nonsensical. However, certain patterns have emerged from encounters with this eldritch being:

Non-Euclidean Movement – Creature Gerald does not walk. It glides, warps, and contorts through space in a manner that defies conventional physics. It can appear in multiple locations at once, vanish without a trace, and re-emerge in impossible places.
Mind-Scrambling Presence – Prolonged exposure to Creature Gerald induces mild existential dread, confusion, and an overwhelming urge to look away. Those who stare too long report visions of impossible geometries, forgotten memories, and a sudden awareness of the void beyond reality.
Unclassified Communication – It does not speak. It does not write. Yet, somehow, its messages are understood—sometimes through feelings, sometimes through intrusive thoughts, and sometimes through symbols that appear in places they were never written.
Paradoxical Existence – Creature Gerald should not exist, yet it does. Any attempt to erase, destroy, or banish it results in nothing happening—as if the universe simply refuses to acknowledge the action.
Personality and Behavior
Creature Gerald does not follow the logic of other Geralds. It does not seek power, knowledge, or control. It has no clear goals, no desires, and no apparent motivation. Instead, it simply exists—lurking in forgotten places, watching silently, waiting for something unknowable.

Indifferent Yet Present – Unlike malevolent entities, Creature Gerald is not actively dangerous. It does not harm, threaten, or interfere—but its presence is undeniably unsettling.
Fascination With the Unseen – It often appears in hidden corners of the Geraldverse, manifesting in places that others ignore. It seems drawn to errors, glitches, and the overlooked spaces between realities.
Unpredictable Interactions – Some claim that Creature Gerald has aided lost travelers, guiding them through the void. Others insist that it merely observes, its motives unknowable. A few unfortunate individuals report losing time, only to find themselves in unfamiliar places after encountering it.
Encounters and Legends
Many stories circulate about the rare and unsettling encounters with Creature Gerald:

The Silent Watcher – There are reports of a figure standing at the edge of existence, motionless, watching. It never moves, never reacts—but it is always there.
The Whispering Glitch – Digital systems across the Geraldverse sometimes experience brief, inexplicable errors, showing glimpses of a warped, unreadable Geraldian figure. Those who try to decipher the images report dreams of infinite corridors and shifting doorways.
The Liminal Lurker – In the forgotten, in-between places—abandoned buildings, quiet backrooms, empty voids—people have claimed to see something skittering in the darkness, vanishing the moment they turn their head.
Creature Gerald’s Place in the Geraldverse
Unlike other Geralds, Creature Gerald has no allegiance. It is not controlled by the Gerald Corporation, nor does it follow the Supreme One. Even the High Overseers of Gerald Management refuse to acknowledge it, likely because they do not understand what it is.

The only thing certain about Creature Gerald is that it exists. And that is enough.

Final Thoughts
Creature Gerald is a paradox—a thing that should not be, yet continues to be. It is neither benevolent nor malevolent. Neither a ruler nor a rogue. It simply lurks, existing just on the fringes of understanding, always watching, always waiting.

And perhaps, one day, we will understand what it is waiting for.

Hamter Gerald, The Infinitely Reincarnating One
"Existence is pain, but at least I keep coming back."

Overview
Hamter Gerald is a peculiar anomaly in the Geraldverse—a being cursed (or perhaps blessed) with infinite reincarnation. Unlike his powerful and divine counterparts, Hamter Gerald does not wield cosmic abilities, multiversal influence, or divine intellect. Instead, his fate is a never-ending cycle of death and rebirth, often triggered by the most mundane, ridiculous, or outright unfortunate circumstances.

Despite this, Hamter Gerald never truly ceases to exist. No matter how many times he meets an untimely and often absurd demise, he simply returns, reborn anew, with no memory of his previous incarnations. This endless cycle has made him both a tragic figure and an object of endless curiosity (and amusement) within the Geraldverse.

Appearance
Hamter Gerald resembles a small, rotund hamster, slightly chubby with an unassuming yet oddly endearing expression. He carries the unmistakable essence of Geraldian energy, yet his form remains fragile and painfully mortal. His tiny paws, twitching nose, and beady little eyes betray none of the grandeur of the Supreme One, yet all of the spirit.

Abilities and Weaknesses
Hamter Gerald possesses only one ability—but it is both a gift and a curse:

Infinite Reincarnation – No matter how many times Hamter Gerald meets his untimely end, he always returns, completely unaware of his past selves. He does not age. He does not evolve. He simply dies and comes back—over and over and over again.
However, his weaknesses far outweigh any advantage his immortality might provide:

He Dies From Everything – Hamter Gerald's lifespan is often measured in minutes. A strong breeze? Gone. A poorly placed banana peel? Finished. A gentle poke? Perished. His durability is comically non-existent, making him the single most fragile entity in the Geraldverse.
No Awareness of His Curse – Unlike some tragic immortals who lament their endless cycle of death and rebirth, Hamter Gerald has no clue what’s happening. Each time he dies, he simply respawns with zero memory, blissfully unaware of the horrific pattern he is trapped in.
Comedic Levels of Misfortune – If there is a possible way for Hamter Gerald to die, it will happen. Whether it’s a falling leaf landing slightly too hard on his head, a stray thought being too powerful for him to handle, or simply existing in the wrong place at the wrong time, Hamter Gerald cannot escape fate.
Notable Deaths
Over his infinite lifetimes, Hamter Gerald has met countless, often ridiculous demises. Some of the most infamous include:

Tripping Over a Nonexistent Object – He fell forward, panicked, and simply... expired.
Looking at Something Too Hard – One time, Hamter Gerald stared at a particularly complex geometric shape and simply ceased to function.
Being Too Happy – Overcome with joy after eating a particularly good sunflower seed, Hamter Gerald ascended out of existence, only to reappear moments later, confused and hungry again.
Getting Crushed by an Atom of Dust – An event so improbable that even the High Overseers of Gerald Management took notice.
Dying of Old Age Within 30 Seconds – His fastest recorded lifespan.
Cultural Significance in the Geraldverse
Hamter Gerald has become a symbol of both existential tragedy and comedic absurdity. To some, he represents the futility of life, an ever-repeating cycle of suffering. To others, he is a walking meme, the ultimate punchline to the cosmic joke that is existence.

Despite his unfortunate circumstances, many Geralds revere Hamter Gerald as a reminder of resilience—after all, no matter how many times he falls, he always comes back. Some scholars in the Geraldian Academy even suggest that he may hold a hidden, higher purpose, one that even the Supreme One has yet to reveal.

Final Thoughts
Hamter Gerald is both the most fragile and the most enduring entity in the Geraldverse. His life is an unending loop of untimely demises, yet his spirit remains unknowingly unbroken. Whether he is a cosmic joke, an unintentional deity, or simply the universe’s most unfortunate creature, one thing is certain:

He will always return.

Flop Gerald, He Who Flops
"Success? No thanks. I prefer the ground."

Overview
Flop Gerald is the embodiment of failure, exhaustion, and absolute surrender to gravity. Where other Geralds strive for power, wisdom, or conquest, Flop Gerald simply collapses—both metaphorically and physically. His existence is defined by falling over at the most inopportune moments, whether due to overwhelming laziness, existential dread, or a sheer refusal to engage with the world.

While many dismiss him as a joke, those who study him closely recognize something deeper—perhaps even a cosmic truth. Flop Gerald is resistance through inaction, a force of nature that defies struggle by embracing total surrender. In a multiverse filled with battles, schemes, and endless power struggles, Flop Gerald simply lets go, and yet, he persists.

Appearance
Flop Gerald’s defining characteristic is his perpetual state of collapse. His posture is eternally slouched, his limbs weak and unmotivated, and his expression vacant yet oddly content. He is often found in positions of pure defeat—face-down on the floor, draped over furniture, or barely clinging to the edge of a chair. His wardrobe consists of rumpled, oversized clothing, as if he never had the energy to dress properly in the first place. His shoelaces are always untied, and his hair is a permanent mess of bedhead and neglect.

Despite his pathetic demeanor, some claim that his flopping is strangely elegant, almost as if the universe itself bends to accommodate his inevitable collapse.

Abilities and Weaknesses
Abilities:
Flop Immunity – No matter how hard he falls, he cannot be harmed. Whether he flops from a chair, a rooftop, or into the vacuum of space, he remains perfectly intact.
Flop Timing Mastery – His collapses always occur at the worst possible moment for those around him, causing disruptions, inconveniences, or paradoxical victories.
Unstoppable Collapse – If Flop Gerald decides to fall, nothing in the multiverse can prevent it. Time, gravity, and even reality itself will bend to ensure his inevitable descent.
Absurd Luck – Miraculously, his flopping often results in accidental victories, such as dodging lethal attacks, avoiding responsibilities, or solving crises entirely by accident.
The Flop Field – His presence generates a psychic aura of exhaustion, weakening the willpower of those nearby. Even the most disciplined beings may suddenly feel the urge to give up and flop alongside him.
Weaknesses:
Zero Motivation – Any attempt to make Flop Gerald stand up and contribute is met with instant, effortless collapse.
Completely Unreliable – He is utterly useless in battle, in diplomacy, or in any scenario that requires even the slightest effort.
Flop Chain Reaction – Being near Flop Gerald for extended periods can cause other Geralds to develop a sense of extreme apathy, leading to mass flop incidents.
Natural Enemy: No Life Gerald – Their encounters result in paradoxes: one refuses to move, the other refuses to log off. If placed in the same room, a Reality Stagnation Event occurs, freezing time until an outside force intervenes.
Notable Flops in Geraldian History
The Great Throne Room Flop
During a high-stakes meeting of the High Overseers, Flop Gerald was summoned to testify before the Gerald Corporation regarding his repeated violations of cosmic efficiency standards. As soon as he stepped into the Throne Room, he collapsed mid-sentence, landing face-down on the sacred Scrolls of True Geraldian Law.

The room fell into chaos, as the Overseers could not decide whether this was a grave insult, an act of defiance, or simply a case of “Flop Happens.” After seventeen days of deliberation, they ruled the incident "Beyond Understanding", setting a legal precedent that allows Flop Gerald to continue existing without consequence.

The War-Ending Flop
During an interdimensional war between the Gerald Corporation and rogue entities, Flop Gerald was mistakenly deployed as a frontline soldier. As soon as he arrived on the battlefield, he tripped over a loose shoelace and flopped onto an enemy control panel.

This accidental impact triggered a shutdown sequence for the opposing fleet’s entire armada, rendering them completely defenseless. Unable to recover from such a humiliating loss, the enemy forces surrendered immediately.

To this day, Flop Gerald is listed in the records as the “Savior of the Geraldverse,” despite having done absolutely nothing intentionally.

The Supreme One’s Disapproval
The Supreme One himself once attempted to command Flop Gerald to rise and prove himself worthy. Flop Gerald, in response, flopped harder than ever before, collapsing into an interdimensional void, momentarily disrupting all known timelines.

It is said that the Supreme One has never spoken of this incident again.

Cultural Impact in the Geraldverse
Many Geralds mock Flop Gerald, viewing him as an embarrassment to the legacy of True Geraldian Lore. However, there are others—scholars, philosophers, and memeologists—who believe that Flop Gerald represents a fundamental truth about existence itself.

A growing movement, known as The Way of the Flop, has emerged among Geraldian intellectuals, who claim that Flop Gerald has achieved the highest form of enlightenment by rejecting all struggles. Some followers believe that ultimate peace can only be found in complete surrender to the Flop.

Rituals and Practices of The Way of the Flop:

The Grand Collapse – A ceremony in which practitioners fall over in unison, celebrating the beauty of doing nothing.
The Flop Meditation – A state of deep relaxation, where followers attempt to channel Flop Gerald’s complete apathy to escape stress.
Flop Divination – Reading the patterns of random collapses to interpret the will of the cosmos.
Despite being unmotivated, unhelpful, and utterly indifferent, Flop Gerald has become a symbol of cosmic absurdity—a reminder that sometimes, in a world full of struggle and ambition, the best thing one can do is lie down and let fate take its course.

Flop Gerald’s Legacy
Though many Geralds chase power, knowledge, and destiny, Flop Gerald does the opposite—and yet, he persists. His existence is a paradox: by doing nothing, he has inadvertently altered history, ended wars, and even defied the Supreme One himself.

The question remains: is Flop Gerald simply the embodiment of cosmic laziness, or is he, in some strange way, the most powerful force in the multiverse?

Whatever the case, one truth remains undeniable:

Flop Gerald will always be there. On the floor. Just vibing.

Sexy Gerald – The Pinnacle of Geraldian Beauty
"Perfection? Oh, darling, I don’t strive for it—I define it."

Introduction
Among the infinite variations of Gerald scattered throughout the vast Geraldverse, one stands above all others in sheer charisma, beauty, and charm—a being so captivating that even the laws of physics seem to bend in admiration. He is Sexy Gerald, the embodiment of pure, unfiltered allure, a walking manifestation of perfection itself.

To witness Sexy Gerald in motion is to gaze upon a living masterpiece. Every step he takes is a symphony of grace and elegance, every word spoken is a melodic enchantment that could turn the most disciplined warrior into a hopeless romantic. He does not conquer through war, deception, or strategy—he conquers hearts effortlessly, with a single glance, a devastating smirk, and the undeniable magnetism of his very existence.

Even the most powerful beings in the Geraldverse fall victim to his overwhelming presence. Kingdoms have crumbled, alliances have dissolved, and cosmic battles have ground to a halt as both armies found themselves too entranced by his smoldering gaze to continue fighting. The Supreme One himself has acknowledged Sexy Gerald’s unquantifiable power, stating:

"There are forces in this world even I do not control. This… is one of them."

Abilities & Attributes
Irresistible Presence
Sexy Gerald radiates an aura of pure attraction, causing those around him to become entranced, enamored, or hopelessly devoted. Even beings who are theoretically immune to charm effects find themselves questioning their own nature. Deities, interdimensional conquerors, and eldritch horrors have been reduced to blushing messes in his presence. Some have abandoned their godly duties just to spend another moment in his vicinity.

Entire civilizations have developed entire belief systems around him, worshiping him as the embodiment of beauty itself. The mere mention of his name has been known to reduce battle-hardened warriors to swooning admirers, leading to countless declarations of love and devotion across the multiverse.

Voice of Pure Velvet
His voice is so smooth, so intoxicating, that even the harshest critics melt into giddy, lovestruck fools at the sound of his words. It is said that:

His whispers alone have led to interdimensional peace treaties, resolving conflicts that had lasted for millennia.
His laughter has made celestial beings question the meaning of divinity.
His soft-spoken words have tamed warlords, convinced rampaging monsters to take up the arts, and inspired entire star systems to write love poetry.
There exists an underground black market where recordings of Sexy Gerald’s casual conversations are sold for astronomical prices. Some claim that listening to his bedtime stories can cure insomnia, heartbreak, and even minor existential crises.

The Perfect Physique
Sexy Gerald does not simply possess peak physical form—he defines it. He is the gold standard by which all forms of beauty are measured, the blueprint upon which ideal aesthetics are based.

Some claim that his abs contain forbidden knowledge—that to look upon them for too long grants visions of divine enlightenment.
Others whisper that his jawline has cut through space-time itself, altering reality with its razor-sharp perfection.
Even the most advanced AI systems have struggled to render his body accurately, as no existing software is capable of calculating such a flawless form.
Statues and paintings of Sexy Gerald have been erected in countless dimensions, with artists dedicating their entire lives to capturing even a fraction of his aesthetic brilliance.

Reality-Breaking Smolder
A single, intense gaze from Sexy Gerald has been known to override logic, physics, and even the laws of magic. Entire universes have experienced temporal distortions due to the sheer force of his attractiveness, with some lesser realities collapsing altogether, unable to withstand his majestic splendor.

A particularly infamous incident involved an advanced civilization developing a hyperintelligent AI designed to analyze and replicate the "Perfect Form." When fed an image of Sexy Gerald, the AI immediately ceased all other functions, declaring:

"There is no purpose in further calculations. We have found the answer to beauty."

The AI self-destructed moments later, unable to process such perfection without breaking down entirely.

Divine Fashion Sense
Sexy Gerald is never underdressed, never overdressed—he is simply dressed correctly at all times. His wardrobe shifts dynamically to match any situation, exuding effortless elegance.

In battle, his armor gleams brighter than the sun, yet somehow retains a practical level of mobility and comfort.
In casual settings, his outfits blend effortlessly with the environment, yet he always stands out just enough to remain unforgettable.
Even in the vacuum of space, his fashion remains immaculate, and his hair continues to flow perfectly despite the lack of atmosphere.
Many have attempted to replicate his style, but none have succeeded—for Sexy Gerald does not follow trends. He defines them.

Influence on the Geraldverse
While Sexy Gerald does not wield political power in the traditional sense, his presence alone has reshaped civilizations:

The Gerald Corporation has repeatedly attempted to contain his influence, fearing that his sheer perfection might lead to Gerald-based instability across the multiverse. Unfortunately, most of their agents immediately defect upon meeting him, swearing lifelong loyalty to his radiant magnificence.
Entire species have altered their genetic structures to imitate his form, leading to a category of lifeforms known as "Geraldian Perfectionists."
Fashion designers, musicians, and poets across dimensions credit Sexy Gerald as their primary muse, despite never having met him.
Even the Supreme One himself has issued a rare statement, acknowledging that Sexy Gerald’s power transcends even his own comprehension.

Weaknesses
Though Sexy Gerald is nearly untouchable, there exist rare circumstances under which his overwhelming perfection might falter:

Self-Reflection – Looking into a perfectly mirrored surface can cause Sexy Gerald to become momentarily entranced by his own beauty. Some scholars debate whether this is truly a weakness or simply an inevitable consequence of being that attractive.
The Unimpressed – While exceedingly rare, there exist a handful of beings in the multiverse who are immune to his charm. These beings are often regarded as unnatural aberrations and widely distrusted by the general populace.
Overwhelming Adoration – There have been instances where entire planets have failed to complete basic infrastructure projects because their inhabitants spent too much time gazing at statues of him.
Perfection Has A Name
Sexy Gerald is not just a Gerald—he is a phenomenon, a force of nature, a living work of art. Whether he is an accident of reality, a divine being, or something beyond comprehension, one truth remains undeniable:

Perfection has a name.

And that name is…

Gerald.

No Life Gerald, The Gamer
"Sleep? Social life? Touching grass? Nah, I got a ranked match."

Overview
No Life Gerald is the embodiment of pure, unfiltered gaming obsession—a Gerald whose entire existence revolves around video games, to the point where reality itself has become nothing more than an annoying distraction. While other Geralds concern themselves with cosmic dominion, interdimensional politics, or divine enlightenment, No Life Gerald has only one goal: grind, win, and achieve absolute gaming supremacy.

His reaction speed is superhuman, his mechanical skill is flawless, and his game knowledge surpasses even the most advanced AI opponents. Despite his godlike talent, however, he is completely and utterly disconnected from everything outside of gaming—including basic responsibilities, physical well-being, and the fundamental concept of “going outside.”

Appearance
No Life Gerald is almost always seen hunched over a gaming setup, bathed in the glow of multiple monitors, with permanent dark circles under his eyes from years (or centuries) of sleep deprivation. His attire consists of an old hoodie, sweatpants, and the unmistakable aura of someone who hasn’t moved in hours. Energy drink cans and half-eaten snacks litter his gaming lair, and his headset is practically fused to his skull.

Abilities and Weaknesses
Abilities:

Perfect Reflexes – No Life Gerald’s reaction speed is so absurdly fast that he can dodge attacks, predict enemy movements, and execute frame-perfect inputs instantly.
Unrivaled Game Knowledge – He knows every exploit, strategy, meta shift, and hidden mechanic across every game ever created (even those that haven’t been made yet).
Multiversal Gaming Presence – He plays across dimensions, dominating leaderboards in not just one universe but every reality where competitive gaming exists.
Inhuman Stamina – He can stay awake for weeks, months, or even years without rest, fueled by an unknown energy source (most likely copium and caffeine).
Weaknesses:

Zero Social Awareness – His ability to interact with anyone outside of a gaming-related conversation is nonexistent. Any attempt to talk to him about real-world topics is met with confusion or outright disinterest.
Physically Fragile – Hasn’t done physical activity in centuries. A strong gust of wind or a light shove could probably knock him out.
Prone to Gamer Rage – Losing a match or encountering “bad teammates” can send him into a multiversal-level meltdown. Entire servers have crashed due to his sheer frustration.
No Concept of "Outside" – The mere thought of going outside or touching grass triggers an existential crisis.
Notable Moments in Geraldian Gaming History
The 72-Hour Duel Against AI Gerald – No Life Gerald once battled AI Gerald in a 72-hour-long, frame-perfect match of Super Ultra Mega Hyper Fighting Turbo EX Championship Edition. The game ended in a draw when both players executed a final move so precise that it broke the in-game physics.
The Rank 1 Incident – No Life Gerald once hacked reality itself to ensure he held the #1 leaderboard spot in every game across all dimensions. The Gerald Corporation had to intervene before his ego collapsed the fabric of space-time.
The Fabled LAN Party – Once, several Geralds attempted to drag No Life Gerald to a LAN party in physical form. The moment he stepped outside, he took 9999 psychological damage, immediately respawned in his gaming chair, and swore to never leave his setup again.
Cultural Impact in the Geraldverse
No Life Gerald is seen as both a legend and a cautionary tale in the Geraldverse. He represents the pinnacle of gaming mastery, yet also serves as a grim reminder of what happens when one forsakes all else for the grind.

Some Geralds worship his skill, seeing him as a divine esports entity, while others pity his existence, believing that one day, he may finally log off and see the world beyond his monitor. But for No Life Gerald, there is no greater goal than victory, no higher purpose than the grind, and no escape from the infinite ranked queue of life.

Final Thoughts
No Life Gerald is the ultimate gamer, a being of pure, unrelenting dedication to his craft. While some may call his lifestyle extreme, he has no regrets—only a never-ending hunger to win, climb, and become the undisputed ruler of every competitive game in existence.

Until then, he remains locked in his battle station, grinding endlessly, forever gaming.

SpongeBob in the Geraldverse – The Eternal Jester of Absurdity
"I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm—wait, where am I?"

Among the countless anomalies, celestial beings, and unfathomable forces that populate the Geraldverse, there exists one entity that defies all conventional logic—not through sheer power, but through the absolute absurdity of his existence. He is SpongeBob SquarePants, an interdimensional constant of chaos, joy, and indomitable willpower, whose presence has been recorded in every Geraldian timeline, reality, and dimension.

Unlike many figures in the Geraldverse, SpongeBob is not a Gerald, nor does he seek to be one. Instead, he appears at random, a cosmic trickster, an unshakable optimist whose actions often bend reality in ways that even the Supreme One himself cannot always predict. Some scholars within the Gerald Corporation have speculated that SpongeBob is a "Fixed Absurdity Point", meaning that no matter how timelines shift, how universes collapse, or how the balance of power changes, he will always exist in some form—smiling, laughing, and causing unprecedented levels of confusion.

Abilities & Powers
Despite his outwardly harmless and cheerful nature, SpongeBob is a force of reality-warping unpredictability. His abilities have baffled, frustrated, and even horrified some of the most powerful beings in existence.

💧 Infinite Durability – The Unbreakable Sponge
SpongeBob has survived planetary explosions, cosmic implosions, fourth-wall breaks, and direct exposure to reality-shattering forces without sustaining permanent damage. In fact, he often laughs it off and continues whatever he was doing beforehand. His indestructibility is not a matter of strength, but rather an inexplicable refusal to acknowledge harm as a real concept.

🎨 Toonforce – The Laws of Physics Are Merely Suggestions
SpongeBob operates entirely on cartoon logic, allowing him to pull objects from nowhere, reshape his body at will, defy the laws of time and space, and achieve feats that should be outright impossible. He can create fire underwater, summon duplicate versions of himself, and even affect his surroundings simply by imagining something hard enough.

🎵 Musical Reality Bending – The Power of Song
In certain instances, SpongeBob's singing has been shown to manipulate reality itself. His songs have ended apocalyptic scenarios, influenced cosmic forces, and even altered the behavior of gods. Some Geraldian scholars believe that music is a primary force in the structure of the Geraldverse, and that SpongeBob, whether knowingly or unknowingly, is one of its greatest wielders.

🌀 Unshakable Optimism – The Ultimate Mental Fortress
Unlike many beings who succumb to madness, despair, or existential dread when faced with the vastness of the Geraldverse, SpongeBob remains completely unaffected. His unwavering joy, enthusiasm, and obliviousness make him immune to psychic attacks, mind control, existential horror, and even the corruption of the Void Geralds. He simply does not acknowledge despair as a concept, making him one of the mentally strongest beings in existence.

🍔 The Krabby Patty Effect – Culinary Alchemy
SpongeBob's cooking, specifically the Krabby Patty, is an enigma that has transcended reality itself. Some claim it contains elements of divine perfection, capable of reducing even the most battle-hardened warriors to tears of joy. Others theorize that the recipe is a fundamental constant of the multiverse, much like the speed of light or the gravitational constant. The Supreme One has classified the Krabby Patty Secret Formula as a Geraldian Tier-0 Anomaly, placing it under extreme surveillance to ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands.

Role in the Geraldverse
SpongeBob’s presence in the Geraldverse is not intentional, yet he somehow always ends up involved in its major events. He is known to randomly appear in different dimensions, often causing both catastrophic confusion and unintended enlightenment wherever he goes.

The Supreme One does not fully understand SpongeBob’s existence. He has stated: "There are many things I comprehend. This sponge… is not one of them."
The Gerald Corporation has repeatedly failed in their attempts to contain, analyze, or classify SpongeBob. Any files related to him inevitably turn into doodles of jellyfish and pineapples before vanishing completely.
The High Overseers of Gerald Management consider him a “Natural Chaotic Constant”, meaning that no matter what they do, he will always reappear somewhere, at some point, for some reason.
Despite all of this, SpongeBob himself remains completely unaware of his cosmic significance. He simply wants to make friends, cook good food, and enjoy life—all while unknowingly shattering the minds of those who attempt to comprehend him.

Weaknesses
While SpongeBob is incredibly durable and unpredictable, he is not completely unstoppable. There are a few things that can hinder him:

Sunday Closures – SpongeBob refuses to work on Sundays, no matter what is at stake. Even if the fate of the Geraldverse depends on it, he simply cannot bring himself to break this rule.
Bubble Popping – If someone pops one of SpongeBob’s bubbles, he will become momentarily heartbroken, giving enemies a brief window of opportunity to act before he recovers.
Bad Work Ethic – SpongeBob’s one true nemesis is laziness and incompetence. If forced into an environment where effort is not rewarded, he will quickly begin to deteriorate emotionally and mentally.
Mayonnaise – It is still unclear why, but SpongeBob has implied that mayonnaise is not an instrument. The implications of this statement are unknown but deeply concerning.
Final Thoughts: The Immortal Absurdity
SpongeBob SquarePants is more than just a simple fry cook—he is a cosmic anomaly, an unbreakable optimist, and an unstoppable force of nonsensical joy that even the Supreme One cannot fully comprehend.

He does not seek power. He does not seek war. He does not seek to control fate itself.

He simply exists.

And in doing so, he forever alters the Geraldverse, one laugh at a time.

Sping Bob – The Crackhead Chaos of the Geraldverse
"I'M READY—FOR DESTRUCTION!!!"

Across the infinite, chaotic expanse of the Geraldverse, where paradoxes are the norm and reality is held together by sheer absurdity, there exists a being so unpredictable, so erratic, that even the Supreme One has deemed him "a threat to coherence itself." He is not a Gerald, nor a god, nor a force of nature—he is something worse.

He is Sping Bob, the feral, hyperactive, and utterly unhinged cousin of SpongeBob SquarePants, an entity that embodies pure, unfiltered, crackhead energy. While SpongeBob is a beacon of cheerful optimism, Sping Bob is a deranged whirlwind of unpredictable destruction, unhinged laughter, and chaotic energy surges. His arrival is never planned, nor is it ever welcomed. He simply appears, wreaks havoc on reality itself, and then vanishes as if he were never there—leaving behind only confusion, broken laws of physics, and at least one fire that no one remembers starting.

No one knows where he came from. No one knows where he goes. But when he arrives, everyone knows.

Abilities & Powers
While Sping Bob lacks tactical intelligence or any real sense of direction, he more than makes up for it with absurd, erratic powers that make him a menace to any and all beings in the Geraldverse.

🔥 Uncontrollable Energy Surges – The Crackhead State
Sping Bob does not run on normal biological functions. Instead, his body operates at an unstable, ever-fluctuating energy level that defies the fundamental rules of thermodynamics. This means he is constantly vibrating at speeds that break the space-time continuum, often leaving afterimages of himself doing things that never actually happened.

🌀 Reality Vandalism – Laws of Physics? Never Heard of 'Em.
Sping Bob does not "bend" reality. He outright vandalizes it. He has been seen running up walls at 90-degree angles, floating in mid-air despite acknowledging gravity, and summoning objects that should not exist—such as flaming wet water, invisible fire, and a burger that is both cooked and uncooked at the same time. Attempts to study his abilities have resulted in scientists quitting their jobs and becoming farmers instead.

🤣 Hyperactive Regeneration – “YOU CAN’T KILL ME, I’M TOO HYPED”
Sping Bob does not feel pain in any way that makes sense. If he is injured, he will simply regenerate by laughing so hard that his wounds disappear. Cutting off his limbs only results in more Sping Bobs forming from the severed parts, creating an exponential crisis that forces reality to reset itself out of sheer frustration.

🔊 Screech of the Damned – The Sound That Ends Worlds
Sping Bob’s voice is beyond mortal comprehension. When he screams, it is not a sound—it is a multiversal event. His screeches have been recorded as causing:

Glass to break across entire dimensions
AI systems to rewrite themselves out of self-preservation
Demons to go deaf out of respect
Celestial gods to log out of reality just to get a break
🚀 Random Teleportation – "I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I'M GOING, BUT I'M GETTING THERE FAST"
Sping Bob does not move in a normal way. He glitches, phases, and teleports unpredictably across time and space, often arriving in places before he even left. This makes it impossible to contain, track, or predict his movements. The only consistent pattern is that wherever he goes, someone, somewhere, will be deeply confused.

Role in the Geraldverse
Sping Bob is not part of any faction. He does not seek power, control, or purpose—he exists purely for the chaos. However, his presence has had unavoidable consequences in the greater Geraldian order:

The Supreme One has declared him "an unsolvable problem." Despite wielding near-absolute power, even he has been unable to predict or contain Sping Bob.
The Gerald Corporation has classified Sping Bob as a Level-XC Anomaly, meaning that no countermeasures exist and the only response to his arrival is to evacuate and pray.
Gerald Prime once attempted to recruit Sping Bob as an agent of chaos—only to immediately regret his decision when Sping Bob ate the concept of causality itself, forcing the entire Geraldverse into an accidental time-loop.
Despite all this, Sping Bob is not evil. He does not act with malice—he is simply an unstoppable force of hyperactivity, confusion, and accidental destruction. His only true goal appears to be:

Having fun
Causing mayhem
Consuming unknown substances that power his limitless energy
Some say that Sping Bob is a test from the multiverse itself—a challenge to those who seek to understand reality. Others believe he is simply a mistake that never got fixed.

One thing is certain: when you hear his laugh, it is already too late.

Weaknesses
While Sping Bob is nearly unstoppable, there are a few rare things that can slow him down:

The Chill Zone – Environments of extreme relaxation and tranquility have been known to confuse and disorient Sping Bob. Places such as meditation gardens, yoga studios, and chill lo-fi beats have been recorded as causing his energy to drop to dangerous levels.
Boredom – Sping Bob thrives on chaos. If placed in a situation with no action, no excitement, and no stimuli, he will eventually glitch out of existence, reappearing somewhere more interesting.
Direct Eye Contact With Himself – If Sping Bob looks into a perfect reflection of himself, he enters a paradoxical feedback loop that can cause him to temporarily crash reality like a corrupted computer file. However, this only works once per timeline—after that, he simply laughs and keeps going.
Lack of Snacks – Sping Bob’s hyper-energy is fueled by unknown substances, often taking the form of mystery snacks. If he is deprived of food for too long, he enters a dormant state—though no one has been brave enough to test this for extended periods.
Final Thoughts: The Ultimate Crackhead
Sping Bob is not a warrior. He is not a ruler. He is not a thinker. He is an uncontrollable, interdimensional force of energy that breaks the very fabric of understanding.

Some believe he is a punishment for those who try to make sense of the universe. Others claim he is a gift—a reminder that not everything needs to make sense.

But one truth remains:

You do not find Sping Bob.

Sping Bob finds you.

Bible, King James Version
Genesis
Gen.1
[1] In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
[2] And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
[3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
[4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
[5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
[6] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
[7] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
[8] And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
[9] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
[10] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
[11] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
[12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[13] And the evening and the morning were the third day.
[14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
[15] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
[16] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
[17] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
[18] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
[19] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
[20] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
[21] And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
[23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
[24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
[25] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
[27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
[28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
[29] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
[30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
[31] And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Gen.2
[1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
[2] And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
[3] And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
[4] These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
[5] And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
[6] But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
[7] And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
[8] And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
[9] And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[10] And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
[11] The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
[12] And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
[13] And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
[14] And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
[15] And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
[16] And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
[17] But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
[18] And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
[19] And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
[20] And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
[21] And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
[22] And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
[23] And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
[24] Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
[25] And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
Gen.3
[1] Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
[2] And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
[3] But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
[4] And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
[5] For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
[6] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
[7] And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
[8] And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
[9] And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?
[10] And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
[11] And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
[12] And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
[13] And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
[14] And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
[15] And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
[16] Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
[17] And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
[18] Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
[19] In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
[20] And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
[21] Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
[22] And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
[23] Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
[24] So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Gen.4
[1] And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
[2] And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
[3] And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
[4] And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
[5] But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
[6] And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
[7] If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
[8] And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
[9] And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
[10] And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
[11] And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
[12] When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
[13] And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
[14] Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
[15] And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
[16] And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
[17] And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
[18] And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
[19] And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
[20] And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
[21] And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
[22] And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
[23] And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
[24] If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
[25] And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
[26] And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
Gen.5
[1] This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
[2] Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
[3] And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
[4] And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
[5] And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
[6] And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:
[7] And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
[8] And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
[9] And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:
[10] And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
[11] And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
[12] And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:
[13] And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
[14] And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
[15] And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
[16] And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
[17] And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
[18] And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:
[19] And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
[20] And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
[21] And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
[22] And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
[23] And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
[24] And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
[25] And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
[26] And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:
[27] And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
[28] And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
[29] And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
[30] And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
[31] And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
[32] And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Gen.6
[1] And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
[2] That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
[3] And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
[4] There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
[5] And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[6] And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
[7] And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
[8] But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
[9] These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
[10] And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[11] The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
[12] And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
[13] And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
[14] Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
[15] And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
[16] A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
[17] And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
[18] But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
[19] And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
[20] Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
[21] And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
[22] Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
Gen.7
[1] And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
[2] Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
[3] Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
[4] For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
[5] And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
[6] And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
[7] And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
[8] Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
[9] There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
[10] And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
[11] In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
[12] And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
[13] In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
[14] They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
[15] And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
[16] And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
[17] And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
[18] And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
[19] And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
[20] Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
[21] And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
[22] All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
[23] And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
[24] And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
Gen.8
[1] And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
[2] The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
[3] And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
[4] And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
[5] And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
[6] And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
[7] And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
[8] Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
[9] But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
[10] And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
[11] And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
[12] And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
[13] And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
[14] And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
[15] And God spake unto Noah, saying,
[16] Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
[17] Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
[18] And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
[19] Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
[20] And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
[21] And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
[22] While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
Gen.9
[1] And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
[2] And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
[3] Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
[4] But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
[5] And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
[6] Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
[7] And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
[8] And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
[9] And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
[10] And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
[11] And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
[12] And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
[13] I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
[14] And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
[15] And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
[16] And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
[17] And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
[18] And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
[19] These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
[20] And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
[21] And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
[22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
[23] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
[24] And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
[25] And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
[26] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
[27] God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
[28] And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
[29] And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
Gen.10
[1] Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
[2] The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
[3] And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
[4] And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
[5] By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
[6] And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
[7] And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
[8] And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
[9] He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
[10] And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
[11] Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
[12] And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
[13] And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
[14] And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
[15] And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
[16] And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
[17] And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
[18] And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
[19] And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
[20] These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
[21] Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
[22] The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
[23] And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
[24] And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
[25] And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
[26] And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and Jerah,
[27] And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
[28] And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
[29] And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
[30] And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
[31] These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
[32] These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
Gen.11
[1] And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
[2] And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
[3] And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
[4] And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
[5] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
[6] And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
[7] Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
[8] So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
[9] Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
[10] These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
[11] And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
[12] And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:
[13] And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
[14] And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
[15] And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
[16] And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
[17] And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
[18] And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
[19] And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
[20] And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
[21] And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
[22] And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
[23] And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
[24] And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
[25] And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
[26] And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
[27] Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
[28] And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
[29] And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
[30] But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
[31] And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
[32] And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Gen.12
[1] Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
[2] And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
[3] And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
[4] So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
[5] And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
[6] And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
[7] And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
[8] And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
[9] And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
[10] And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
[11] And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
[12] Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
[13] Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
[14] And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
[15] The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
[16] And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
[17] And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
[18] And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
[19] Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
[20] And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
Gen.13
[1] And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
[2] And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
[3] And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
[4] Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
[5] And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
[6] And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
[7] And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
[8] And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
[9] Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
[10] And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
[11] Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
[12] Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
[13] But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
[14] And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
[15] For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
[16] And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
[17] Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
[18] Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.
Gen.14
[1] And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
[2] That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
[3] All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
[4] Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
[5] And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
[6] And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
[7] And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.
[8] And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
[9] With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
[10] And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
[11] And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
[12] And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
[13] And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eschol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
[14] And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
[15] And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
[16] And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
[17] And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
[18] And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
[19] And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
[20] And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
[21] And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
[22] And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
[23] That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
[24] Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
Gen.15
[1] After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
[2] And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
[3] And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
[4] And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
[5] And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
[6] And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
[7] And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
[8] And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
[9] And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
[10] And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
[11] And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
[12] And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
[13] And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
[14] And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
[15] And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
[16] But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
[17] And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
[18] In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
[19] The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
[20] And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
[21] And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
Gen.16
[1] Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
[2] And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
[3] And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
[4] And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
[5] And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.
[6] But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
[7] And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
[8] And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
[9] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
[10] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
[11] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
[12] And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
[13] And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
[14] Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
[15] And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
[16] And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Gen.17
[1] And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
[2] And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
[3] And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
[4] As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
[5] Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
[6] And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
[7] And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
[8] And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
[9] And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
[10] This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
[11] And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
[12] And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
[13] He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
[14] And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
[15] And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
[16] And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
[17] Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
[18] And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
[19] And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
[20] And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
[21] But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
[22] And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
[23] And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
[24] And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
[25] And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
[26] In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
[27] And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
Gen.18
[1] And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
[2] And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
[3] And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
[4] Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
[5] And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
[6] And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
[7] And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
[8] And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
[9] And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
[10] And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
[11] Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
[12] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
[13] And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
[14] Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
[15] Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
[16] And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
[17] And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
[18] Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
[19] For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
[20] And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
[21] I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
[22] And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
[23] And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
[24] Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
[25] That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
[26] And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
[27] And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:
[28] Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
[29] And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
[30] And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
[31] And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
[32] And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
[33] And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
Gen.19
[1] And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
[2] And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
[3] And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
[4] But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
[5] And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
[6] And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
[7] And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
[8] Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
[9] And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
[10] But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
[11] And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
[12] And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
[13] For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
[14] And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
[15] And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
[16] And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
[17] And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
[18] And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:
[19] Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
[20] Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
[21] And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
[22] Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
[23] The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
[24] Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
[25] And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
[26] But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
[27] And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
[28] And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
[29] And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
[30] And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
[31] And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
[32] Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
[33] And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
[34] And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our Father.
[35] And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
[36] Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
[37] And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
[38] And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
Gen.20
[1] And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
[2] And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
[3] But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
[4] But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
[5] Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
[6] And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
[7] Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
[8] Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
[9] Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
[10] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
[11] And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
[12] And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
[13] And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
[14] And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
[15] And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
[16] And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
[17] So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
[18] For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
Gen.21
[1] And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
[2] For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
[3] And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
[4] And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
[5] And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
[6] And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
[7] And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
[8] And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
[9] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
[10] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
[11] And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
[12] And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[13] And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
[14] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
[15] And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
[16] And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
[17] And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
[18] Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
[19] And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
[20] And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
[21] And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
[22] And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
[23] Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
[24] And Abraham said, I will swear.
[25] And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
[26] And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
[27] And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
[28] And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
[29] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
[30] And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
[31] Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.
[32] Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
[33] And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
[34] And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
Gen.22
[1] And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
[2] And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
[3] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
[4] Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
[5] And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,
[6] And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
[7] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
[8] And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
[9] And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
[10] And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
[11] And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
[12] And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
[13] And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
[14] And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
[15] And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
[16] And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
[17] That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
[18] And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
[19] So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
[20] And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
[21] Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
[22] And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
[23] And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
[24] And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
Gen.23
[1] And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
[2] And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
[3] And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
[4] I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
[5] And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
[6] Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
[7] And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
[8] And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
[9] That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
[10] And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
[11] Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
[12] And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
[13] And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
[14] And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
[15] My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
[16] And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
[17] And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
[18] Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
[19] And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
[20] And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
Gen.24
[1] And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
[2] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
[3] And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
[4] But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
[5] And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
[6] And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
[7] The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
[8] And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
[9] And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
[10] And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
[11] And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
[12] And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
[13] Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
[14] And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
[15] And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
[16] And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
[17] And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
[18] And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
[19] And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
[20] And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
[21] And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
[22] And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
[23] And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
[24] And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
[25] She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
[26] And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
[27] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
[28] And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
[29] And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
[30] And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
[31] And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
[32] And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
[33] And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
[34] And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
[35] And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
[36] And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
[37] And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
[38] But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
[39] And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
[40] And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
[41] Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
[42] And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;
[43] Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
[44] And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.
[45] And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
[46] And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
[47] And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
[48] And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
[49] And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
[50] Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
[51] Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
[52] And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.
[53] And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
[54] And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
[55] And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
[56] And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
[57] And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
[58] And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
[59] And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
[60] And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
[61] And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
[62] And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
[63] And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
[64] And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
[65] For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
[66] And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
[67] And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Gen.25
[1] Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
[2] And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
[3] And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
[4] And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
[5] And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
[6] But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
[7] And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
[8] Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
[9] And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
[10] The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
[11] And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
[12] Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
[13] And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
[14] And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
[15] Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
[16] These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
[17] And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
[18] And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
[19] And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
[20] And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
[21] And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
[22] And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
[23] And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
[24] And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
[25] And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
[26] And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
[27] And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
[28] And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
[29] And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
[30] And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
[31] And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
[32] And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
[33] And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
[34] Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
Gen.26
[1] And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
[2] And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
[3] Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
[4] And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
[5] Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
[6] And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
[7] And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
[8] And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
[9] And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
[10] And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
[11] And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
[12] Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
[13] And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
[14] For he had possession of flocks, and possessions of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
[15] For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
[16] And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
[17] And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
[18] And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
[19] And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
[20] And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
[21] And they digged another well, and strove for that also:and he called the name of it Sitnah.
[22] And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
[23] And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
[24] And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
[25] And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
[26] Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
[27] And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
[28] And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
[29] That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.
[30] And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
[31] And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
[32] And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
[33] And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
[34] And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
[35] Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Gen.27
[1] And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.
[2] And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
[3] Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
[4] And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
[5] And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
[6] And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
[7] Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.
[8] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
[9] Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
[10] And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
[11] And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
[12] My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
[13] And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
[14] And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
[15] And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
[16] And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
[17] And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
[18] And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
[19] And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
[20] And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.
[21] And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
[22] And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
[23] And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
[24] And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
[25] And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
[26] And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
[27] And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
[28] Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
[29] Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.
[30] And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
[31] And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
[32] And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
[33] And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
[34] And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
[35] And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
[36] And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
[37] And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
[38] And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
[39] And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
[40] And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
[41] And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
[42] And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
[43] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
[44] And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;
[45] Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
[46] And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
Gen.28
[1] And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
[2] Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
[3] And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
[4] And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
[5] And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
[6] When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
[7] And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
[8] And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
[9] Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
[10] And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
[11] And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
[12] And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
[13] And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
[14] And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
[15] And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
[16] And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
[17] And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
[18] And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
[19] And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
[20] And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
[21] So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
[22] And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
Gen.29
[1] Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
[2] And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.
[3] And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
[4] And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
[5] And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
[6] And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
[7] And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
[8] And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
[9] And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
[10] And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
[11] And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
[12] And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
[13] And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
[14] And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
[15] And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
[16] And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
[17] Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
[18] And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
[19] And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
[20] And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
[21] And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
[22] And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
[23] And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
[24] And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
[25] And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
[26] And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
[27] Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
[28] And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
[29] And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
[30] And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
[31] And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
[32] And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
[33] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
[34] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
[35] And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
Gen.30
[1] And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
[2] And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
[3] And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.
[4] And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
[5] And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
[6] And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
[7] And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
[8] And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
[9] When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
[10] And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
[11] And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
[12] And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
[13] And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
[14] And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
[15] And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
[16] And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
[17] And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.
[18] And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
[19] And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
[20] And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
[21] And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
[22] And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
[23] And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
[24] And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.
[25] And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
[26] Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
[27] And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
[28] And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
[29] And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
[30] For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
[31] And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:
[32] I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
[33] So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
[34] And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
[35] And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
[36] And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
[37] And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
[38] And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
[39] And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
[40] And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
[41] And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
[42] But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
[43] And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
Gen.31
[1] And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.
[2] And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
[3] And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
[4] And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
[5] And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
[6] And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
[7] And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
[8] If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
[9] Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
[10] And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
[11] And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
[12] And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
[13] I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
[14] And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
[15] Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
[16] For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
[17] Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
[18] And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
[19] And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
[20] And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
[21] So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
[22] And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
[23] And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
[24] And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
[25] Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
[26] And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
[27] Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
[28] And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
[29] It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
[30] And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
[31] And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
[32] With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
[33] And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
[34] Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
[35] And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
[36] And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
[37] Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
[38] This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
[39] That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
[40] Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
[41] Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
[42] Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
[43] And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
[44] Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
[45] And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
[46] And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
[47] And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
[48] And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
[49] And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
[50] If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
[51] And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
[52] This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
[53] The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
[54] Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
[55] And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
Gen.32
[1] And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
[2] And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
[3] And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
[4] And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
[5] And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
[6] And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
[7] Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
[8] And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
[9] And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
[10] I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
[11] Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
[12] And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
[13] And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
[14] Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
[15] Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
[16] And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
[17] And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
[18] Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
[19] And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
[20] And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
[21] So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
[22] And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
[23] And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
[24] And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
[25] And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
[26] And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
[27] And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
[28] And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
[29] And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
[30] And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
[31] And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
[32] Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
Gen.33
[1] And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
[2] And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
[3] And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
[4] And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
[5] And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.
[6] Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
[7] And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
[8] And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
[9] And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
[10] And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
[11] Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
[12] And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
[13] And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
[14] Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
[15] And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
[16] So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
[17] And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
[18] And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
[19] And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
[20] And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
Gen.34
[1] And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
[2] And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
[3] And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
[4] And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
[5] And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
[6] And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
[7] And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
[8] And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
[9] And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
[10] And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
[11] And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
[12] Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
[13] And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
[14] And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
[15] But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
[16] Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
[17] But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
[18] And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
[19] And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
[20] And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
[21] These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
[22] Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
[23] Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
[24] And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
[25] And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
[26] And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
[27] The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
[28] They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
[29] And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
[30] And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
[31] And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
Gen.35
[1] And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
[2] Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
[3] And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
[4] And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
[5] And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
[6] So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
[7] And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
[8] But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.
[9] And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.
[10] And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
[11] And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
[12] And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
[13] And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
[14] And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
[15] And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.
[16] And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
[17] And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
[18] And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
[19] And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
[20] And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
[21] And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
[22] And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
[23] The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
[24] The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
[25] And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
[26] And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.
[27] And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
[28] And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
[29] And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Gen.36
[1] Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
[2] Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
[3] And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
[4] And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
[5] And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
[6] And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
[7] For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
[8] Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
[9] And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
[10] These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
[11] And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
[12] And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
[13] And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
[14] And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
[15] These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
[16] Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
[17] And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
[18] And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
[19] These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.
[20] These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
[21] And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
[22] And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
[23] And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
[24] And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
[25] And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
[26] And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
[27] The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
[28] The children of Dishan are these: Uz, and Aran.
[29] These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
[30] Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
[31] And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
[32] And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
[33] And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
[34] And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
[35] And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
[36] And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
[37] And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
[38] And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
[39] And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
[40] And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
[41] Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
[42] Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,
[43] Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.
Gen.37
[1] And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
[2] These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
[3] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
[4] And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
[5] And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
[6] And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
[7] For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
[8] And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
[9] And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
[10] And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
[11] And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
[12] And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
[13] And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
[14] And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
[15] And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
[16] And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
[17] And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
[18] And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
[19] And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
[20] Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
[21] And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
[22] And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
[23] And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
[24] And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
[25] And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
[26] And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
[27] Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
[28] Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
[29] And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
[30] And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
[31] And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
[32] And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
[33] And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
[34] And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
[35] And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
[36] And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
Gen.38
[1] And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
[2] And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
[3] And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
[4] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
[5] And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
[6] And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
[7] And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
[8] And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
[9] And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
[10] And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
[11] Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
[12] And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
[13] And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
[14] And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
[15] When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
[16] And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
[17] And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
[18] And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
[19] And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
[20] And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
[21] Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
[22] And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
[23] And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
[24] And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
[25] When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
[26] And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
[27] And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
[28] And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,
[29] And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
[30] And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
Gen.39
[1] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
[2] And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
[3] And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
[4] And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
[5] And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.
[6] And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.
[7] And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
[8] But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
[9] There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
[10] And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
[11] And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
[12] And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
[13] And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
[14] That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
[15] And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
[16] And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
[17] And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
[18] And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
[19] And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
[20] And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
[21] But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
[22] And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
[23] The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.
Gen.40
[1] And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
[2] And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
[3] And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
[4] And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
[5] And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
[6] And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
[7] And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?
[8] And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
[9] And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
[10] And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
[11] And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
[12] And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
[13] Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
[14] But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
[15] For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
[16] When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
[17] And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
[18] And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
[19] Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
[20] And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
[21] And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
[22] But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
[23] Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
Gen.41
[1] And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
[2] And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
[3] And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
[4] And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
[5] And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
[6] And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
[7] And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
[8] And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
[9] Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
[10] Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
[11] And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
[12] And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
[13] And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
[14] Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
[15] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
[16] And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
[17] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
[18] And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
[19] And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
[20] And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
[21] And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
[22] And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
[23] And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
[24] And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
[25] And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
[26] The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
[27] And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
[28] This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
[29] Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
[30] And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
[31] And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
[32] And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
[33] Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
[34] Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
[35] And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
[36] And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
[37] And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
[38] And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
[39] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
[40] Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
[41] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
[42] And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
[43] And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
[44] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
[45] And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
[46] And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
[47] And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
[48] And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
[49] And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
[50] And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.
[51] And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
[52] And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
[53] And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
[54] And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
[55] And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
[56] And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
[57] And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
Gen.42
[1] Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
[2] And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
[3] And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
[4] But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
[5] And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
[6] And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
[7] And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
[8] And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
[9] And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
[10] And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
[11] We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
[12] And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
[13] And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
[14] And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
[15] Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
[16] Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
[17] And he put them all together into ward three days.
[18] And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
[19] If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
[20] But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
[21] And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
[22] And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
[23] And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
[24] And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
[25] Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
[26] And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
[27] And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
[28] And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
[29] And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
[30] The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
[31] And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:
[32] We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
[33] And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
[34] And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
[35] And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
[36] And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
[37] And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
[38] And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Gen.43
[1] And the famine was sore in the land.
[2] And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
[3] And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
[4] If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
[5] But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
[6] And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
[7] And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
[8] And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
[9] I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
[10] For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
[11] And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
[12] And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
[13] Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
[14] And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
[15] And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
[16] And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
[17] And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
[18] And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
[19] And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
[20] And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
[21] And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
[22] And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
[23] And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
[24] And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
[25] And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
[26] And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
[27] And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
[28] And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
[29] And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
[30] And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
[31] And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
[32] And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
[33] And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
[34] And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
Gen.44
[1] And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
[2] And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
[3] As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
[4] And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
[5] Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
[6] And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
[7] And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
[8] Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
[9] With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
[10] And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
[11] Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
[12] And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
[13] Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
[14] And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
[15] And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
[16] And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
[17] And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
[18] Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
[19] My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
[20] And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
[21] And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
[22] And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
[23] And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
[24] And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
[25] And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
[26] And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
[27] And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
[28] And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
[29] And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
[30] Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
[31] It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
[32] For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
[33] Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
[34] For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
Gen.45
[1] Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
[2] And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
[3] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
[4] And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
[5] Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
[6] For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
[7] And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
[8] So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
[9] Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
[10] And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
[11] And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
[12] And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
[13] And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
[14] And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
[15] Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
[16] And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
[17] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
[18] And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
[19] Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
[20] Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
[21] And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
[22] To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
[23] And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
[24] So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
[25] And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
[26] And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
[27] And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
[28] And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
Gen.46
[1] And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
[2] And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
[3] And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
[4] I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
[5] And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
[6] And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
[7] His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
[8] And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
[9] And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
[10] And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
[11] And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
[12] And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.
[13] And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
[14] And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
[15] These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
[16] And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
[17] And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
[18] These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
[19] The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
[20] And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.
[21] And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
[22] These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
[23] And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
[24] And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
[25] These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
[26] All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
[27] And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
[28] And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
[29] And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
[30] And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.
[31] And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
[32] And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
[33] And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
[34] That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Gen.47
[1] Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
[2] And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
[3] And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
[4] They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
[5] And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
[6] The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
[7] And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
[8] And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?
[9] And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
[10] And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
[11] And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
[12] And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
[13] And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
[14] And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
[15] And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
[16] And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
[17] And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
[18] When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
[19] Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
[20] And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
[21] And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
[22] Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
[23] Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
[24] And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
[25] And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
[26] And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
[27] And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
[28] And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
[29] And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
[30] But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
[31] And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
Gen.48
[1] And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
[2] And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
[3] And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
[4] And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
[5] And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
[6] And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
[7] And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
[8] And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
[9] And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
[10] Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
[11] And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
[12] And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
[13] And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
[14] And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
[15] And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
[16] The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
[17] And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
[18] And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
[19] And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
[20] And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
[21] And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
[22] Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Gen.49
[1] And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
[2] Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
[3] Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
[4] Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
[5] Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
[6] O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
[7] Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
[8] Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
[9] Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
[10] The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
[11] Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
[12] His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
[13] Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
[14] Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
[15] And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
[16] Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
[17] Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
[18] I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
[19] Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
[20] Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
[21] Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
[22] Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
[23] The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
[24] But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
[25] Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
[26] The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
[27] Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
[28] All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
[29] And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
[30] In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
[31] There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
[32] The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
[33] And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
Gen.50
[1] And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
[2] And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
[3] And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
[4] And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
[5] My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
[6] And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
[7] And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
[8] And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
[9] And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
[10] And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
[11] And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
[12] And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
[13] For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
[14] And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
[15] And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
[16] And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
[17] So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
[18] And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
[19] And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
[20] But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
[21] Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
[22] And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
[23] And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
[24] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
[25] And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
[26] So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
